These events are routinely attended by enthusiastic fathers, eager to introduce their wonderful daughters to the young and single winery master.This is all highly entertaining to the other guests, who watch on and comment, mockingly:\"We'd much rather Master Diluc stays married to the winery, given how good this wine is!\"Diluc deals impeccably with all situations, no matter who or what comes his way.Diluc is a fine young gentleman in every conceivable respect."

Master Crepus' wish was for his son to become the most esteemed knight of all and safeguard Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.As per his father's wishes, Diluc trained rigorously to make himself worthy of the Ragnvindr name. Sure enough, he passed the Knights of Favonius' trials, swore the oath of protection to Mondstadt, and entered their ranks. Before long, he received an early promotion which saw him become the youngest-ever Cavalry Captain.Over the course of his missions and patrols, the denizens of Mondstadt gradually came to know this young and passionate Cavalry Captain.No matter what the missions demanded from him, he always maintained his composure and his passion. No matter how big the challenge before him, his boundless courage always led him to the front line. The praise he received from his comrades and citizens spurred him on.But the words of praise he valued most of all were:\"Good job. Now, that's my son.\"His father's words fueled the fire inside his heart and served as his greatest motivation.His faith was an unquenchable fire that burned strong and bright inside him.Diluc was so young back then."

The monster was stronger than any foe the young Cavalry Captain had ever encountered, and overpowered him.Diluc could never have anticipated the way this battle would end: His father, who had been denied admittance into the Knights and who was shunned by the gods, defeated the monster with an unknown evil power — before that same power backfired, mortally wounding Crepus himself. Crepus died shortly after in his son's arms.With a heavy heart, Diluc returned to the Knights' headquarters, only to receive an unthinkable order from Inspector Eroch: \"Conceal the truth.\"Eroch insisted that the incident must be portrayed as an unfortunate accident in order to maintain the reputation of the Knights of Favonius in the eyes of the public.Such was the sheer outrageousness of this request that Diluc did not think it was even worth trying to argue.Diluc's father had once said to him that the world would never turn its back on the faithful.But now, the Knights of Favonius trampled on his faith like it was nothing. He couldn't help but wonder: What was his father's view on faith in his final moments?Diluc resigned from the Knights that day and left everything behind, including his Vision.He swore to avenge his father's death, and to find the source of that occult power which had caused his father's demise."

He learned that they made counterfeit Visions in secret, calling them \"Delusions.\" A Delusion could amplify the power of its bearer to its extreme, but also carried the risk of backfiring. That was what had caused his father's death.Was it possible that his father could have obtained such a sacrilegious item in order to do good?Diluc knew he may never know the full truth, but that could never stop him from pursuing it.Like an eagle scouring the wilderness, he set off on his hunt for the truth. Determination burned like fire in his heart, unfathomable enigmas and unending battles could not sway him from his course. He pressed on relentlessly, scarred but undeterred, like a fiery tornado burning through the dense fog of mystery.The Fatui's rulers, the Harbingers, monitored Diluc's progress from the shadows. The prowess with which he laid waste to numerous Fatui strongholds caught their attention and forced them to take action.Diluc narrowly escaped death at the hands of the Harbingers thanks to a third-party observer from the north, who was part of a vast underground intelligence network. The observer claimed to have been watching Diluc for some time, and approved of his methods.After his close encounter with death, Diluc took a long hard look at his past and the anger he had harbored for so long. Acknowledging his shortcomings, he decided to join the underground intelligence network.Just like when he first joined the Knights of Favonius, Diluc committed himself fully to his work. His talents and skills saw him rise steadily through the ranks into the upper echelons of the network.The network was made up of volunteers, and many of its members had willingly given up their prior positions and reputations to join. Some had even abandoned their names.Could working with these new comrades finally restore the faith he once clung to? The faith that had been all but destroyed in the events surrounding his father's death?"

    "text": "\"Shine True.\" The background to this motto is hotly contested, but to Diluc it has one simple, clear meaning.\"Evil cannot go unpunished.Never settle for mediocrity. Never forget that the dawn will one day come.\"Diluc's solitary sojourn lasted for three years.Four years on, Diluc had returned to Mondstadt and taken over as head of the family winery, now a young man.In the space of these four years, Eroch had been purged from the Knights of Favonius after being shown to be a traitor, while Grand Master Varka had left on an expedition, leaving Master Jean to assume the role of Acting Grand Master.The return of the Dawn Winery's master should have been a momentous occasion for Mondstadt, but strangely it went completely unnoticed.The reason? Mondstadt's citizens were far too busy pondering the mysterious case of an unknown \"Guardian of Mondstadt.\"All that was known about the anonymous guardian was that the smell of burning would follow in his wake, and that a flash of red flames would reveal his silhouette for but a moment in the darkness of the night, before he disappeared in an instant.The bodies of monsters that had plagued Mondstadt for an age now lay dead in the wilderness... Mondstadt's most wanted thieves suddenly appeared bound and gagged, hanging from their feet in the statue plaza... All the Knights of Favonius were dispatched to reckon, once and for all, with the Abyss Mage behind countless crimes in the city, but they arrived only to discover that he had long since been killed...Aided by wine-fueled conversations, word of the mysterious guardian spread swiftly, and he came to be known as the \"Darknight Hero.\"In public, Diluc appeared to hold this hero in contempt, his face curling up in disgust every time the name was uttered.Elzer of the Mondstadt Wine Guild was one of the select few who was in the know, and once queried Diluc about this: Was his disapproval of the Darknight Hero just an act, intended to throw the knights off his trail and protect his anonymity?But Diluc simply frowned once more, and curtly replied: \"It's just a stupid name.\""

    "text": "Crepus had two regrets in life. One was never becoming a knight, and the other was never obtaining a Vision.For this reason, in the moment that Diluc received his Vision, he took it as a recognition by the gods of his and his father's shared ambition — finally, he could make his father proud.Just a few years later, his father died on a dark and gloomy day. The hopes and dreams that burned bright in Diluc's Vision were extinguished in the torrential rain that fell on that night.No matter how upright and good-hearted a person may be, death will still come to them without warning.Is this where the tale of justice ends? Just like that?It seemed to him that his Vision and his status as a knight were both equally ineffectual at enabling him to protect the things that he treasured most. It was time to discard them both, he decided.When he recognized his own powerlessness, his Vision became but a burden, of no greater service than a Delusion.Empty titles were of no interest to him. He sought after ardent flames that would burn brighter than any other, and an unshakable resolve. Only a firm resolve can drive the truth-seeker forward, and only ardent flames can vanquish the ice that freezes the hand of justice.On the day that Diluc returned to Mondstadt, he took up his Vision once more. The events of his years away had purged him of his childish immaturity, and turned him into a hero ready to shoulder his father's will once more. Each night, from the shadows, he fought for Mondstadt.He did not discuss the past. But he did not deny the past, either.To the lost, perhaps a Vision is a beacon of light given by the gods to help them find the path forward.But to those with conviction, a Vision is simply an extension of their strength, a medium for channeling their willpower, a tribute to the experiences that have shaped them, and a testament to the story of their life so far."

If she catches Qiqi performing her calisthenics in the courtyard, she will wind about Qiqi's shoulders and help her keep time with a \"one two three one two three,\" and so on. If she runs into Herbalist Gui delivering medicine in the corridor, she will rest on his arm and ask after the latest neighborhood gossip.<!--\n              -->After the talking is done, the medicine weighted and packaged, and the tea has cooled, it is time for lunch. At this time, Baizhu is at leisure to personally prepare a nutritious meal and sweet soup that are both healthy and tasty for all who come to call.<!--\n              -->Afternoons in Liyue Harbor are a leisurely affair, with studying children, tottering old grandparents, Millelith carrying spears... An endless patter of footfalls. Changsheng and Qiqi lie by the pharmacy door, basking in the sun and watching the flow of people. They idly observe that the one on the left has let their hair grow too long and needs a haircut, while that one on the right has a rash on their face, and might be suffering from an internal imbalance. The sound of their chatter reaches Herbalist Gui's ears, and fearing disturbing others, he brings over a bench and moves Changsheng and Qiqi back inside the pharmacy.<!--\n              -->The commotion reaches Baizhu's clinic, and he listens to their exchange as he writes a prescription. Time is like boiling water in a copper kettle: at once both a turbulent tumult but also sitting quietly beside you.<!--\n              -->As night falls, Bubu Pharmacy closes for the day. Herbalist Gui sometimes stays for dinner, and sometimes goes home to eat with his family. Then only Baizhu, Qiqi, and Changsheng remain, and the two people and one snake may eat and drink to their hearts' content, returning to their rooms to rest by the light of the moon.<!--\n              -->One cannot call such a day anything out of the ordinary. It is simply a day at Bubu Pharmacy. Though, if Herbalist Gui suddenly had the thought to come back and take a peek before going to bed, more like than not he would happen upon Baizhu teaching Qiqi new exercises in the courtyard to keep her limber.<!--\n              -->One-two-three, one-two-three... Morning, noon, and night, spring, summer, and fall — oh, and also winter... Calisthenics and life both have their rhythm."

    "text": "The storyteller rapped the wooden table, opened his mouth, and began to tell a tale of ghosts and demons. Though the public loves to hear these stories, they get old after too many tellings, and so people asked, \"is there anything else? You've told the one about the jewel-seller and the one about the thief, what else is there?\"<!--\n              -->At that moment, Baizhu came down the stairs, and the audience saw him and thought to themselves: Dr. Baizhu has many stories, surely, but putting them into a book might be far too difficult. Other than discussing his exemplary behavior and medical ethics, if one wishes to say a few words about him over tea or after dinner, the most that can be talked about is the Doctor's private pursuit of the adeptal arts and the like, a matter that Baizhu has never intended to conceal.<!--\n              -->There are a multitude of visitors to Bubu Pharmacy, and those with sharp eyes cannot avoid noticing the books Baizhu reads in his spare time. In addition to medical treatises are ancient tomes which record the ways in which the adepti may be sought out. In addition, the medicine chests at Bubu Pharmacy contain a multitude of rare herbs and ingredients which are of no use in treating common illnesses, but are constantly used and replenished in an endless cycle. Though the average patient may not understand the arcane implications, those from families which practice alchemy or thaumaturgical arts can instantly recognize that all of these are ingredients used to refine various \"Elixirs of Immortality\" spoken of in legend.<!--\n              -->For most ordinary people, \"immortality\" is simply too strange a concept. But there are people whose curiosity will be aroused, and who will seek to know just how Baizhu wishes to attain immortality and how far along the road he has come... But this has proved akin to walking on a tightrope at night — it is difficult to take even a single step.<!--\n              -->Eventually, news of Baizhu's quest spread. Once the news was leaked, people formed an opinion. Some coveted his knowledge, some opposed this pursuit, and others didn't particularly care about his goal of immortality, but were concerned about the trouble his methods might cause.<!--\n              -->Baizhu himself was in his clinic, but his fingers were on the pulse of the street, and he had anticipated this would happen. In the vast land of Liyue, the concerns of the third group of people would be the most difficult to assuage. He had initially planned to quietly dispel any doubts, but the name \"Baizhu\" had already appeared on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' persons of special interest list. Fortunately, Baizhu always conducted himself impeccably in his daily life, and is amiable and willing to chat with his patients during their consultations. From these visits, he learned that the Ministry of Civil Affairs was keeping a close eye on him.<!--\n              -->He saw through their methods, and turned the ears and mouths of the people to his own ends, letting them spread the word on his behalf that his research and approach had no ill intent and would cause no trouble.<!--\n              -->Rumors spread more quickly than the most infectious pathogen, and soon the fact his quest was benign had spread to every corner. This push and pull between Baizhu and Ministry continued for some time, but eventually he was able to avoid unwanted attention and his name avoided appearing in the top secret intelligence reports of the owner of Yanshang Teahouse, Yelan.<!--\n              -->As for the aforementioned second group of people, their beliefs are already a known quantity, and set in stone. Many are the descendants of a clan that believes firmly in the principle that some things are divinely ordained, and that the impermanence of life and permanence of death are among those immutable truths. It must be pure coincidence that the representative of this second group lives but a street away at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.<!--\n              -->As the saying goes, neighbors are like relatives and friends, and Bubu Pharmacy and Wangsheng Funeral Parlor have had many interactions over the years, and both parties greet each other with a smile when their paths cross in the street. As for those questions of life and death, death and life, the opinion of the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Hu Tao is as follows: If the matter cannot be explained or settled in a couple words, it's better to have Baizhu over for dinner! And as for a sensible person like Baizhu? Of course one should attend the banquet! Season after season, year after year, without going into too much detail, the two households with very different views have spent many a day together, and could be considered close friends, albeit with each keeping their secrets.<!--\n              -->When two parties do not align closely, they merely speak of etiquette. But when they align, one may speak of duty. For Bubu Pharmacy is in the business of healing the sick, and in the course of business it is inevitable that there will be those beyond saving or at the end of their lives. Those with good fortune are cared for by their family, but those less lucky will breathe their last in Bubu Pharmacy. When this happens, Bubu Pharmacy and Wangsheng Funeral Parlor will jointly ensure their final rest is peaceful.<!--\n              -->The last rites and journey of the deceased is of great importance, and Director Hu Tao entrusts this to her most dependable consultant, Zhongli. For Bubu Pharmacy, Baizhu cares greatly for those patients who pass away under his care, and personally sees to their arrangements. The two parties hold a ceremony in a secluded thatched cottage in the dead of night. Baizhu sends the deceased there, and the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor consultant holds the ceremony and performs the final rites, carrying out each step in an orderly manner. Even if it is simply going through the motions, the departed may rest in peace.<!--\n              -->It is a pity that though the soul has passed on, no living soul will ever thank Bubu Pharmacy or Wangsheng Funeral Parlor on the deceased's behalf. But the heavens wheel ever onward, and so too does the cycle of life and death continue unceasingly. Doctor and Funeral Director and consultant are neighbors by coincidence, friends over the dinner table, but only truly meet heart-to-heart when conducting the solemn duty of seeing off the souls of the deceased. Once they walk out of that thatched cottage, they return to their former selves.\nAs for the aforementioned first type of people, those who covet the secret of immortality, though they are many in number, their methods are crude, and they are easy to deal with.<!--\n              -->Bandits are common in the wilderness and in the mountains, and a few particularly stupid and shortsighted ones once ran into Baizhu alone on a mountain road. Baizhu was refining medicine, and the bandits, having heard rumors of Baizhu's quest, came to the conclusion that he had made something of value here in this remote location. They struck, expecting to plunder the secret medicine Baizhu had created. A few hours later, the Millelith arrived at the scene of the crime, having received a report. It was difficult to tell who was the real victim, with the ruffians laid out upon the ground and Baizhu standing beside them with a smile.<!--\n              -->\"The facts of the case come first, so forgive me for asking,\" the Millelith soldier began hesitantly, \"but did you really come to place this remote just to make cold medicine?\"<!--\n              -->\"If I was refining some special medicine...\" Baizhu laughed and shook his head. \"Would they ever have found me?\"<!--\n              -->These stories traveled round and round, eventually returning to the ears of the storyteller. He thought for a moment, then shook his head and sighed: \"Forget it. At the end of the day, Dr. Baizhu is just a doctor. What fascinating tales could there be?\""

    "text": "Every time the weather turns cold, the threshold of Bubu Pharmacy is crowded with patients seeking a consultation. But today, Baizhu's silhouette was nowhere to be seen. Only his assistant Herbalist Gui was at the counter, prescribing medicine and dispensing medicine. Those with recurring illnesses who visited frequently knew what this meant. It was \"one of those days\" again, and so they took the medicine carefully wrapped by Herbalist Gui. They offered their best wishes, such as \"Please tell Dr. Baizhu to care of himself,\" and shuffled out the door.<!--\n              -->At that moment, Qiqi came in from the doorway and bumped into an old man's calf. Holding her hat tight, she nodded and hurried to the back room with her stiff steps as quickly as she could.<!--\n              -->\"It's one of those days\" isn't a particular time or place, but rather is shorthand for an oft-used statement: The Doctor is ill, and cannot see patients today, so we are sorry you came all the way here for nothing, please come back some other time.<!--\n              -->It is hard for physicians to cure themselves, and this is true for Baizhu as well. Baizhu claims that it is simply a chill, but he knows that he has a weak constitution, and all of his internal organs are diseased. Though his life is not in imminent danger, nine out of ten doctors would be dumbstruck, only able to gape in wonder at the nature of this rare and incurable disease. Therefore, whenever his symptoms flare up, all Herbalist Gui and Qiqi can do is bring him hot water, cloth towels, and plates of fruit to show their concern. Baizhu does not wish others to worry on his behalf, and insists on being alone in his room with only Changsheng for company.<!--\n              -->With the curtains pulled over the tightly closed windows, the room was dark and gloomy. Baizhu lay down, tormented by the chills and following hot flashes, occasional breathing problems, and intermittent yet intense full-body pains that often came whenever his symptoms flared up. After a bout of agony, he joked to Changsheng, \"If I don't make it one of these days, it'll be a giant hassle, won't it?\"<!--\n              -->Changsheng slithered up the head of the bed and looked down at Baizhu's sweat-soaked visage with human-like pupils. \"Oh you, oh you, you may lie, but you may not die. Who is it that wishes to live forever? You are not yet old, and haven't yet experienced a full life.\"<!--\n              -->A man and a snake, the snake with human eyes and the man with snake eyes. A strange phenomenon indeed. Few know the truth behind such an enigmatic anomaly. In fact, the pupils in their eyes are proof of their greatest secret — the contract between them. The result of this contract is the Baizhu of today — practicing medicine to save lives and alleviate the pains and aches of humanity, but also embedding illness deep into his own bones, where they reside forever with no hope of relief.<!--\n              -->And in the land of Rex Lapis, God of Contracts, the law is supreme and contracts must be abided by. Liyue is an ancient country with a multitude of spiritual beings and magic, and the contents and types of contracts are equally varied. But Baizhu and Changsheng never discuss the contents of their own contract, and always share the same response: Contract? It's just an agreement, you could say it's just a secret technique with a couple of restrictions on how it can be passed down. Those too old or young, those who are insincere of heart, the inhuman, all of these cannot inherit this technique... What else is there? Oh, yes. \"Those not fated to cannot inherit it!\"<!--\n              -->Qiqi put down the tea tray and hot water, closing the door behind her as she left. Baizhu watched her leave before let out a long sigh, as though he had a thousand worries caught in his throat, but was unable to give voice to a single one. All he could do was shift the conversation to a distant rumor—<!--\n              -->In ancient times, there was once a Mt. Yaojun, and the master of the mountain and their tea-loving friend once made a pact to wait until the tea trees on the mountain had grown, then hold a tea banquet, inviting all the adepti to partake of their tea. What a beautiful thing that might have been! But alas, of the two Adepti who made the agreement, one sank into the water like the residual remnants of tea leaves, and the other lost all ten of their fingers for picking tea, and even their memories of the past faded and were forgotten.<!--\n              -->Changsheng hissed an impatient reply: \"What's so strange about that? The adepti are gone, but don't their tea trees remain? The tree and tea leaves will remember their ancient agreement in their stead. You should worry more about yourself, for if you and I leave, only Herbalist Gui, Qiqi, and the wood of the house and bricks on the floor will remember the two of us.\"<!--\n              -->The name of the contract with Changsheng is known as \"Way of the Dragon-Dragging Jade Snake.\" Only the name of contract is known, and not even Changsheng can explain the details, only that she learned it long ago. If you ask who she learned it from, she cannot recall even a bit of tangential information. Talking about the distant past with Changsheng is often like this. Baizhu is used to listening to her advice, though, and understands she has good intentions. Thus did he vomit up the blood stuck in his throat before sitting up straight against the head of the bed.<!--\n              -->Changsheng glanced over: \"What're you looking at me for? I don't have hands to support you with.\"<!--\n              -->Cradling the soup made for him by Herbalist Gui and Qiqi, Baizhu slowly drank it. He got through it one spoonful at a time, his eyes never leaving the soup for a moment, as though there was an entrancing scene of spring flowers and autumn leaves at the bottom of the bowl.<!--\n              -->The small things, one at a time. The basic essentials of daily life. Life is like soup, boiling and cooking."

The people of Liyue call their particular art \"Zhanbu.\"<!--\n              -->It is said that in ancient times, medicine and \"Zhanbu\" were tightly linked and often confused. With no scientific understanding of birth, old age, sickness, or death, the ancestors could do naught but pray to the gods for wellness and take medicinal herbs for comfort.<!--\n              -->Over time, countless generations experiencing sickness and recovering upon taking different herbs were able to distill their knowledge into a set of rules, making breakthroughs in their understanding of medicine. Thus was medicine born, with trained physicians curing the sick.<!--\n              -->After becoming an heir to this medical tradition, Baizhu brought Changsheng to Liyue Harbor to open a pharmacy and practice medicine in the bustling port city. At that time, the following story took place:<!--\n              -->According to the traditions of Liyue, new businesses must divine an auspicious time for their grand opening using the art of \"Zhanbu.\" By sticking to the preordained opening day, the business will prosper and enjoy fame and fortune.<!--\n              -->But Baizhu did not wait until the day of good fortune.

Besides, what pharmacy wants business to boom? We aren't hoping for more people to get sick, are we?\"<!--\n              -->\"That doesn't mean you should just throw open the doors without even thinking of a name for our shop! And what about a celebratory message for the grand opening?\"<!--\n              -->\"A name and a message... Then let us send the message that no matter the fortunes of this shop, or the diseases afflicting our patients...\" Baizhu picked up the prescription note and faced the rising sun framed through the door. \"...Or our fates, we don't need to ask the gods or use divination any longer.\"<!--\n              -->In the language of Liyue, \"Zhanbu\" is divination, but \"bu\" can also be the word for a refusal or negation. Thus, he chose a name that enshrined his beliefs.<!--\n              -->The rays of sunlight were shining through the door and the thin paper in his hand, with the words written by his hand clear and confident—<!--\n              -->\"Bubu Pharmacy, Baizhu.\""

Hey, come back, I'm still talking to you!\"Barbara is forever anxiously chasing after Rosaria, urging her to complete her various daily tasks.Yet even when faced with Barbara, the beloved idol of Mondstadt, Rosaria remains completely unmoved.Surely her heart can't be completely made of stone?"

Sometimes, if she makes it back by the crack of dawn, she gets to usher in the day ahead with a glass of breakfast wine.The people of Mondstadt live in the golden sunlight, but Rosaria dwells under the silver moonlight.It is a cold, piercing light... just like that of the ice she forms with her Cryo abilities.\"There are some things that young people need not know,\" Rosaria thinks.Though, in her eyes, \"young people\" means all citizens of Mondstadt who live in the light of the sun, regardless of their age."

Why does she stay silent while others praise the gods for their protection?Perhaps it should come as no surprise that Rosaria was not born and bred in Mondstadt.\"A city that is fortunate enough to be boring always needs someone to do the dirty work...\"Rosaria stubs her cigarette out as she speaks in her characteristically languid manner.\"And as far as I'm concerned, the things I deal with are far simpler than living the life of a traditional sister.\""

As their youngest member, Rosaria was judged to have a chance of rehabilitation.Grand Master Varka brought her to Mondstadt. Sincerely hoping that she might someday fit in here, he advised her:\"Go to the Cathedral and be cleansed by the light of our archon. You still have the chance to turn your fate around and live a normal life.\"But Varka had not counted on Rosaria constantly skipping classes and dodging hymnal.She would rather hunt in the wild than settle into a life of dutiful service as a sister. As far as she was concerned, the golden sunlight was not so much cleansing as blinding.For Rosaria had long since come to understand that she was a child of the moonlight, and it was inevitable that she would someday return to the embrace of darkness."

Miss Rosaria, I'm told that you have never attended a single one of your compulsory classes. Is that so?\"\"Yes.\"\"Mother Maria, please look at this... Rosaria's theological essay is an utter mess!\"\"Miss Rosaria, if I may ask frankly... do you intend to do any work at all here at the Church?\"\"No. I've already found other work.\"Rosaria never showed so much as a hint of anxiety in any of these exchanges. What's more, it was true — she had indeed found other work for herself, and much darker work at that.The unexpected twist was that she would ultimately end up doing this work under the aegis of the Church.Rosaria the novice did not leave the clergy, but instead became Sister Rosaria without much incident.Nevertheless, when she's not on a mission, she does everything she can to avoid attending church activities, instead heading to the taverns to drink or scaling the city walls to view the scenery.And when she simply cannot escape a church engagement, you can be sure that she will be the first to leave.The instant the workday is done, Rosaria vanishes.Whether by bright day or dark night, there is one principle that she will never transgress: no overtime."

Kill me, and you can leave this place. I'm long in the tooth now, while you've got youth on your side. You can do this, can't ya?\"No one thought that she would be able to kill him — and yet, the old lion would indeed fall by the newborn cub's claws.Thus did the bandits lose an old member and welcome a new one that very night.The bandits were reluctant to accept Rosaria at first since she had slain one of their own, but they quickly had a change of heart after seeing the Vision in her hand.Surely, a Vision wielder had to be far stronger than some old coot who was about to kick the bucket right? And she ate less, to boot... They could save some food this way.Meanwhile, a question crept into Rosaria's frozen heart:Did he let me replace him on purpose? ...Could a false father have harbored genuine affection for a child he stole so arbitrarily?"

    "text": "For many years, Fontainian cuisine — exemplified by a focus on elegant sophistication — has been a popular palate-pleaser throughout Teyvat. If you were to inquire among food critics as to what best embodies the principles of Fontainian food, few if any would omit the great \"former head chef of the Hotel Debord,\" Escoffier, from the forefront of their name lists.In the eyes of discerning diners, Escoffier is both the founder of \"precision gastronomy\" and a leading proponent of \"the principles of innovative cuisine.\" She excels at taking flavorings measured with the precision of scientific rigor and crafting them into dazzling, dynamic taste experiences.According to countless food critics, she is a \"demon chef\" who continues to breathe new life into the culinary world while sending shivers down the spines of dietary dinosaurs — those stubbornly unreceptive to change and fresh avenues in culinary evolution. While improving the industry's technology and techniques, she has successfully lowered the costs involved, effectively democratizing high-end dining and putting famous dishes on the tables of ordinary folk.According to her students and peers, she is discipline incarnate. There is no slacking on her watch — even the tiniest mistakes caused by a lapse in concentration or momentary distraction are met with scathing critiques. Crafting a dish worthy of even a perfunctory nod of approval requires absolute respect for each ingredient and the utmost sincerity and caution at every stage of the cooking process.As Navia and her other friends see it, Escoffier is a patient and thoughtful woman who finds inspiration in complex symphonies and conversations with companions alike. Joining her for a spot of afternoon tea is much like opening a surprise gift — there is always something new and unexpected in store.Yet for Escoffier, there is no dwelling on past glories — in her eyes, there is only the now and her goals for the future. Even when tasting a creation into which she has poured her heart and soul, she only stops to enjoy her work for a fleeting moment before turning her attention to the tiniest of flaws that even a seasoned critic would fail to notice.\"There's still a long way to go to achieve perfection!\""

    "text": "Escoffier displayed an unusually keen awareness from an early age... almost shockingly so.Her sense of taste was particularly sharp, a characteristic that combined with her natural curiosity to remarkable effect.When her parents were distracted, she would rush into the kitchen and try every ingredient and seasoning she could find. She would then categorize them based on whether they were sweet, savory, sour, or spicy, and neatly rearrange them based on flavor intensity. She would then gesture to her mother to point out which flavors she preferred.While other children were playing aimlessly and carefree, Escoffier was busy discerning which baguettes had been out of the oven for too long and were no longer fresh. She would eagerly signal her mother to replace these stale loaves with freshly-baked ones. Seeing her little arms waving and her eyes blinking furiously, her mother would cut her off a few extra pieces of bread and ladle her a fresh bowl of soup, mistakenly believing she was trying to signal her hunger.Of course, Escoffier's parents weren't so well off that they could afford to throw out bread the second it lost its freshness. And so Escoffier, then only two, learned how to use salt, butter, sugar, and pepper to create fresh flavors for every meal.Watching this unfold, her parents, themselves chefs, realized their daughter's particular interest. So, they provided her ever more seasonings to play with, giving her the tools and freedom to express her creativity.In whatever free time they had between teaching their daughter poetry and art, Escoffier's parents would introduce the history of cooking, inculcating in her the solemn significance of being a chef — starting with the adage that \"The pristine white of a chef's uniform shines as brilliant as the plumage of a snow-winged goose.\"It wasn't long before Escoffier was completely immersed in the wonderful world of food. She asked her parents to take her along to work, sitting and observing from the quietest corner of the restaurant. With the owner's permission, they would make a little extra sample with each dish they cooked so that the curious Escoffier could taste every style and flavor.They were as yet unaware that in Escoffier's mind, this was nothing less than diligent study.This exceptional talent would only continue to evolve and improve until she attained an awe-inspiring virtuosity.No matter what dish was put before her, with just a single taste and a few minutes of careful consideration, Escoffier could not only list each ingredient and seasoning but even estimate the amounts used.Eventually, at the ripe old age of four, she took a decisive step on her culinary journey — identifying ingredients and flavoring food was no longer enough. She was determined to start cooking dishes that could satisfy her tastes — to create cuisine that would shock the world!\"How about I make dinner tonight?\"For her first ever dish, Escoffier eschewed the more common starting points and attempted a Golden Trinity Roulade — fish, poultry, and offal coated in batter and fried until a wondrous, golden interplay of complex flavors was achieved.This was by no means an easy dish to make. Only by preparing each ingredient with care and precision could the correct balance of flavors be achieved. The slightest inaccuracy could easily result in a dish that is torment for the tongue.Escoffier followed the recipe to a T, carefully measuring each ingredient and seasoning and strictly controlling the timing of each stage. Her tiny hands were a blur of activity, anxiety turning her face red as she spent a hectic two hours toiling away.Her first, somewhat clumsy attempt at cookery did not have a fairytale ending — this was no case of the genius chef destined to turn every dish she touched into culinary gold.While her parents were full of praise for her Golden Trinity Roulade — enthusing quite genuinely over their meal — once they left and Escoffier had tried it herself, a frown quickly spread across her face.She had failed to cook a dish that she found truly satisfying.\"There's something missing, a certain je ne sais quoi...\"That night, Escoffier lay in bed thinking, unable to sleep...\"Perhaps... I haven't eaten enough food... I haven't prepared enough meals... Was my seasoning off?\"\"Reading a recipe and following the instructions as-is... It's not enough!\"From that point on, Escoffier had a clear goal to work towards...She would try more food, expand her culinary horizons, and create delicacies that would make the world gasp in awe!"

    "text": "\"Expand my culinary horizons\"... Such a simple goal, and yet, one that required considerable expenditure.Wishing to avoid burdening her parents, Escoffier decided to embark on a culinary campaign despite her young age.She found a nondescript restaurant far from the prying eyes of anyone who might recognize her and diligently worked her way up to an apprenticeship in the kitchens.By observing the chefs as they cooked dish after dish — all while helping them complete vital steps in the preparation process — Escoffier quickly familiarized herself with the specific challenges posed by wide varieties of food.Whenever a customer was less than satisfied, Escoffier would try a sample of their dish and combine her own taste with her memories of how the chef had cooked it to analyze the problem.At the same time, mistakes are inevitable amidst the kitchen's heat, and stove-side pitfalls are impossible to predict from staring at recipes and textbooks alone.The chefs in Escoffier's restaurant already thought she was too young to work in the kitchen. So, even when she knocked over a pot full of food, they couldn't bring themselves to scold her.But Escoffier requested she receive no special treatment — every harsh word, every sharp reprimand, she wanted to hear them all.If she didn't like what they said, then it was her job not to make the same mistake again.It was these unpredictable pitfalls that Escoffier needed to quickly identify and commit to memory, adding them to her growing pool of \"experience\".In a short six months, her understanding of cooking had grown by leaps and bounds, and she was soon ready to cook the restaurant's signature dishes unsupervised.This tiny apprentice, barely taller than the stovetop, would stand on a chair, wielding utensils that weighed half as much as she did, and produce dish after dish of remarkable quality.Seeing this, the restaurant owner was moved by her passion and granted Escoffier the title of \"petit chef.\" Her apprenticeship was over, and she was given a salary to match her new position.Almost all the Mora that Escoffier earned in those early days was spent on \"sampling delicacies.\"Every day off they had, she would invite her parents to visit the famous restaurants of the Court of Fontaine, sampling each establishment's most exceptional offerings.While her parents were busy enthusing over the novel flavors of this high-end cuisine, Escoffier was deep in contemplation, considering the steps that must have been taken to prepare each dish and committing to memory every last spark of inspiration.The more delicious food she tried, the more her own cooking excelled, the more Mora she could earn, and the more delicious food she could try... As Escoffier spiraled ever upward on this culinary cycle, she became increasingly engrossed in the grandness of gastronomy.But there was one delicacy that she had been unable to sample...The legendary Gateau Debord had swept through the culinary world like wildfire only a hundred years before. Yet, after the untimely death of the Hotel Debord's original head chef, the recipe had vanished from history.Later generations had made repeated attempts to reconstruct the recipe from scattered records of the time. Many of these replicas had themselves made waves in the culinary circles of Fontaine.Escoffier had tried them all, and while they were indeed sweet and delicious, she was always left with an inexpressible sense of disappointment — surely, there was more to the legendary cake than this?Around Escoffier's fifth birthday, a great chef from the Spina di Rosula created another such replica, one that was rumored to be almost identical in taste to the original.The Spina even arranged for the Hotel Debord itself to host a grand tasting ceremony, whose opening day just so happened to fall on Escoffier's birthday.There would be a mere sixteen pieces on offer each day. Naturally, these were quickly reserved for famous celebrities and people of note — there was no hope of securing a taste for someone like Escoffier, no matter how much she might desire it.On the day of her fifth birthday, Escoffier begged her parents to take her to the Hotel Debord. Even if she couldn't try it, perhaps she could learn something about the legendary gateau just from its color, shape, and smell.In the end, unforeseeable events conspired to provide her with far more than just a glimpse and a whiff of fragrance — outside the hotel, a sudden gust swept up an exquisite hat and whisked it into Escoffier's hands.She searched high and low until, finally, following the unmistakable scent of roses wafting from the hat, she managed to find its equally fragrant owner — a somewhat anxious Navia.By way of thanks, Navia invited Escoffier to sample the delightful piece of cake that had been reserved specially for her by the great chef who had baked it.\"Honestly, it's nothing! I'll let you in on a little secret...\" Navia lowered her voice and, after making sure no one was listening, whispered to the hesitant Escoffier, \"I've tried it loads of times when no one was looking... and personally, I prefer macarons!\"With that, Escoffier's curiosity overcame her polite hesitancy, and she eagerly dug into the cake that Navia had just handed her.It was indeed delicious, yet far from perfection. To Escoffier's tastes, it was no better or worse than the other imitations she had tried.But this was a coveted gift from a new friend standing right in front of her — not to mention the work of a chef from the organization said friend's family ran... Was this the time for an honest appraisal?\"How is it? Do you like it? Tell me what you really think!\"Navia's appeal erased any lingering doubt. When facing a friend — when facing food — only the truth will do.And so, as she would go on to do countless times in the years to come, Escoffier gave her frank, exacting assessment:\"...It's nothing special.\""

    "text": "A vast and formidable gulf must be bridged for the merely \"exquisite\" to be elevated to the \"enchanting.\"\nAfter carefully analyzing and comparing the many imitations she had tried over the years, Escoffier decided that she too would attempt to recreate the Gateau Debord she had so long dreamed of.She would attempt to use this stunning creation as a stepping stone to ascend to the pinnacle of the culinary world.With no recipe to follow, she had no choice but to cycle through the more common ingredients, hoping to slowly \"derive\" the perfect flavor.If taking an existing recipe and learning how to prepare it, then modifying and improving upon what was already there can be compared to building a house with a tried-and-tested blueprint before decorating it in a different style...Then, Escoffier's method of \"derivation\" should be compared to building an entirely new house from scratch.Should an ingredient lend a dish an unexpected flavor, or if the proportions of each component are slightly off, the structure will topple, and the entire dish must be rebuilt from the ground up.To this end, on top of her regular work at the restaurant, Escoffier started taking on \"custom orders,\" where customers would provide her with ingredients and requirements, and she would craft dishes for them that were not on the menu.Doing so allowed her to push beyond her comfort zone and learn to adapt to unexpected requests. By familiarizing herself with a variety of ingredients in the heat of battle — continuously experimenting with new pairings and combinations — she could uncover both the original and latent flavors of every ingredient.Years passed in unending experimentation and refinement, as Escoffier created a detailed \"Flavor Profile Chart\" and developed her own unique culinary philosophy.She named her new school of cooking \"precision gastronomy.\" It was a style unfettered by a set repertoire of ingredients but instead grounded in understanding the fundamental flavor of each component. She honed in on precise measurements and analysis of the reactions occurring at each stage of the cooking process to create a truly bottom-up approach to cooking.At this point, Escoffier finally felt as though she had — if only barely — joined the ranks of the cooking establishment. From this moment on, she poured all her effort into advancing the frontiers of food and challenging the boundaries of perfection.By harnessing the principles of her budding precision gastronomy, Escoffier successfully created a new dessert that was not simply exquisite but truly enchanting.Benefiting from the popularity of her earlier \"custom orders,\" her new cake took the Court of Fontaine by storm, flying off countertops throughout the city.It caused such a stir that news of this new sweet treat made its way to Furina, whose curiosity was piqued. In between performances, she took the time to visit Escoffier's restaurant and see what the fuss was all about.When Furina appeared at the restaurant, the whole scene fell silent. Knives and forks stopped in mid air as diners stared in shock, while the chefs' hands were trembling so much that they were unable to continue cooking.Only Escoffier quickly regained her composure after a brief moment of shock. It was she who greeted Furina with earnest elegance and, after a few seconds of careful preparation, delivered her new signature dessert to the superstar's table.It was then that Furina noticed a peculiar emotion in Escoffier's eyes.Fervor? No... it was like she was entranced.It was as though this young chef had been waiting for just such an opportunity. Every dish she prepared was given her absolute care and attention — and now that she had the chance to present her food to the Hydro Archon herself, she seemed like someone stepping into the spotlight, eagerly awaiting Furina's verdict.Now even more curious than ever, Furina picked up her knife and fork and began to hum a lilting melody as the delicate flavors of the Lily Sugar-Glazed Opera Cake danced on her tongue like the notes of a sweet symphony.When she had finished, Furina immediately broke out into enthusiastic praise. She carefully confirmed the source of each sweet sensation and twice asked Escoffier's name before leaving.That night, Escoffier couldn't sleep. To have suddenly received such praise from Furina left her feeling like she was in a dream — a dream so wonderful she could hardly believe it was real...If she awoke, would she ever be able to relive this fantasy?The answer, it turned out, was yes. The next day, she received an envelope from the Palais Mermonia. Inside was a letter of special appointment.Many years later, when Furina discussed her first meeting with Escoffier at a tea party, she recounted how amazed she was at the young chef's assured demeanor and composed grace.At that moment, Escoffier displayed a rare lapse of composure yet managed to retain her customary frankness as she responded:\"To be honest, my mind went completely blank. I was cooking purely on instinct.\""

    "text": "\"Dearest Escoffier, your superlative dessert brought me so much joy yesterday! Your wonderful talents are simply unrivalled...\"\"To this end, I have decided to appoint you as my personal 'Patissiere Supreme'!\"In a reception room at the Palais Mermonia, Furina personally placed an exquisite chef's hat on Escoffier's head, awarded her with a commemorative badge — one of Furina's own design — and bestowed upon her a title with no equal in the culinary world.For Escoffier, this was the ultimate encouragement — a position of great responsibility in Furina's court. She could feel the pride in her heart surge like a tidal wave of motivation.And with it, her resolve grew, too — she was determined to keep creating dishes that would satisfy her new patron.However, even the Palais Mermonia had a budget to keep, and a well-fitted kitchen was seen as an expense too far. What facilities there were would only allow for the preparation of simple dishes, with no way for Escoffier to fully express her culinary genius.As a result, she needed a fully-equipped restaurant where she could prepare Furina's desserts before carefully packaging them, sealing them, and delivering them to her master's table.Fortunately, the Hotel Debord extended a timely offer, creating the new role of \"Technical Head Chef\" especially for her. She was now nominally on a par with the hotel's head chef and could freely use even the rarest and most expensive ingredients to create unparalleled dishes for Lady Furina.It was a mutually beneficial arrangement. Escoffier gained access to the finest equipment and ingredients, while each of her prestigious desserts now bore a label reading \"Creation of the Hotel Debord\" — further cementing the establishment's reputation throughout Fontaine.What the hotel seemed to have overlooked, however, was that Escoffier was no simple pastry chef, and her culinary talents stretched far beyond the boundaries of the sweet. After all, Furina could hardly be expected to eat cream, frosting, and fruit filling for three meals a day — she required her Patissiere Supreme to dabble in the realm of the savory, too.And so it was that Escoffier spent this period of her life putting her talents into practice without restraint, honing her cooking skills until she had reached the peak of her craft.She recreated the hotel's classic dishes with impeccable skill while improving upon many of their recipes, even reviving several others that had been thought lost to time.The head chef at the time was a no-nonsense and experienced old hand who had already picked her chosen successor. However, upon seeing the advantages Escoffier held in all culinary domains, she decided to let the two younger chefs duel it out in friendly competition.Escoffier did not disappoint. She cooked a bowl of Wave-Kissed Sands — a dish that appears simple and unassuming at first glance but whose preparation is fraught with potential pitfalls. The dish left those who tasted it stunned, and even her rival was convinced that Escoffier should take her place as the new head chef.Just like that, she became the youngest head chef in Hotel Debord's history. The commemorative badge that Furina had given her — now a symbol of her personal image — would grow to embody the pinnacle of cutting-edge gastronomy.Under her stewardship, the hotel's chefs pushed the limits of possibility, elevating the quality of every dish in their repertoire. Even the most pedantic of critics would find no fault in their food.After just six months in her post, Escoffier had reached the pinnacle of her profession. She was now recognized as Fontaine's most illustrious chef since Modeste — the hotel's \"genius\" founder.But no journey through life is without roadblocks, and hers was no exception.After a while at the Hotel Debord, she discovered that her development had plateaued.Every group of diners has its own unique \"food culture\" — an ingrained inertia shaped by time, history, and environment. These deeply rooted conventions were not something Escoffier could overturn on her own.For example, a well-dressed couple of noble stock would find it just as hard to imagine taking up their finely polished knives and forks and digging into a mound of fish and chips as a thrifty worker would find it to nibble on foie gras with their family.Because of this, the food that Escoffier could create while at the Hotel Debord was limited by the tastes and cultural horizons of her clientele.Not to mention, the dramatic influx of customers caused by the hotel's increased popularity put a huge strain on her, as she was now in charge of not only ensuring the quality of every dish but also managing the entire kitchen staff.All of these factors conspired to restrict her exploration and experimentation with flavor.But... could she really throw away the title of head chef that she had worked so hard to achieve — and abandon the hotel's unrivalled culinary environment — all to chase a hazy goal with no clear way forward?Before Escoffier could make up her mind, an unexpected event decided her fate on her behalf.A dangerous and prohibited substance, lumiline, was found in the hotel's food. The news spread like wildfire throughout Fontaine, and her chefs were all in a panic.As the head chef, Escoffier felt responsible for allowing the contamination to occur. To protect the hotel's reputation and calm unrest among the staff, she resigned her post. But it was not enough, and she found herself dragged before the court and sentenced.All her doubts and frustrations would now have to accompany her to the lonely prison beneath the waves."

    "text": "From Furina's personally appointed Patissiere Supreme and a legendary chef praised by all to a criminal languishing in the Fortress of Meropide...Escoffier's fall from grace was steep — it was the kind from which many might never return.Fortunately, Escoffier had never been cowered by danger — the more precarious her predicament, the more calm she became. If anything, her brief stay in the Fortress of Meropide gave her a new sense of perspective. She would later jokingly refer to this time as her \"first period of seclusion\" — a time spent cultivating her skills.The food at the Fortress of Meropide's Coupon Cafeteria — far from the haute cuisine she was used to — could generously be described as a lottery. One where the jackpot was a meal so bad it was like an extra sentence. And yet, it allowed her to consider the possibilities of precision gastronomy from a whole new angle.No longer focused on recreating specific flavors or arriving at set results, she turned her attention to testing as many taste combinations as possible. Every ingredient had depths to be plumbed, each one capable of creating unthinkable flavors with the right companion, thereby granting access to a wider world of seasonings to be used.With this newfound motivation, her underwater life no longer seemed so stifling — though she still felt a pang of regret:At times, the Fortress of Meropide was as noisy as a factory assembly line, while at others, it was as quiet as the yawning void. Thinking back to the atmosphere of the Hotel Debord, where melodious music always filled the halls, left her deeply saddened.Then one day, Furina and Navia came to visit, bearing a small record player. To Escoffier, the lilting notes of songs she had once grown tired of were like the first drops of rain after a long drought. As she was reminded of all the dishes she had enjoyed while listening to these songs, a surge of inspiration welled up inside her.From this day forward, the lumiline case that had landed her in prison no longer held any real significance for her.The very next day after leaving the Fortress of Meropide, Escoffier invited her friends — including Navia — to a banquet. She chose a song with an undulating melody and a soothing rhythm and let the music inspire her as she created a dozen or more dishes, each one greeted by astonished gasps from her guests. As for the new creation she sent to Lady Furina, named \"Autumn Frost,\" it was so well-received that Furina couldn't help but dance with joy.Upon her release, Escoffier did not return to the Hotel Debord. Instead, she settled into a peaceful life at a tavern by the Fleuve Cendre that Navia had recommended.This was to be the beginning of her \"second period of seclusion.\" Only matters relating to food could be allowed to disturb her thoughts.Even the sudden arrival of a catastrophic flood could not distract her from her purpose — she would not leave on the rescue boats until all of her utensils and ingredients had been properly sealed and secured. The second the flood waters receded, she was back in her kitchen.Escoffier's goal was not simply to create a dessert that would surpass the Gateau Debord and present it to Furina — her ultimate aim was to demolish the boundaries of traditional cooking entirely.She did not attempt to tackle this cultural inertia head-on. Instead, like blending colors on a palette, she gradually introduced new flavors, fostering quiet, subtle innovation and progress.Over time, she would create a world without shackles, where even the humblest dishes could grace the tables of fine dining establishments and the most lavish cuisine could shed its haughty airs.The ultimate goal was to discover a new peak of gastronomic pleasure. Even if this peak couldn't be reached in a single lifetime, Escoffier was determined to ascend toward it.This would be a never-ending journey in pursuit of flavor, unbound by time or place. Whenever a new idea formed or an unfamiliar ingredient was discovered, she would throw every ounce of her being into researching it.Escoffier understood well the challenge she faced. It almost seemed to be reflected in her eyes — that shining peak of ultimate flavor, destined to refract the endless brilliance of her inspiration, like the pristine white plumage of a snow-winged goose..."

    "text": "Experienced chefs are used to dealing with multiple sets of ingredients at once. As the pioneer of precision gastronomy, Escoffier frequently found herself whirling through the kitchen like a spinning top.While other chefs might take established ingredients and season them to achieve a desired flavor, her approach was to construct a \"flavor protocol\" based on the underlying principles of each dish. This process requires precise dissection of ingredients, complex cooking modalities, refinement, distillation, and a host of techniques that could add literally dozens of steps to the cooking process.As a result, Escoffier began to explore the limits of multitasking. While preparing to cook each dish, she would divide the tasks that needed to be performed and plan them out in order down to the second, just as though she were a musician performing a dress rehearsal.Her well-choreographed cooking was such that this process became known throughout the culinary world as the \"Kitchen Waltz.\"But after training in this manner for some time, she suddenly came to her senses:\"I'm a chef, not a performer on the stage!\"For Escoffier, it was vital that she spread the load by not only taking on extra help but also developing more convenient tools.And so, when she first started taking on \"custom orders,\" she sought out the help of a group of engineers from the Fontaine Research Institute. Based on her requirements, these mechanical experts together created the \"Experimental Multi-Purpose Gastromek Assembly,\" comprising her two capable assistants, the \"All-Spectrum Multi-Use Cooking Mek\" and the \"Self-Adapting Movement Signal Tracking Support Mek.\"The All-Spectrum Multi-Use Cooking Mek functioned as a combined cooking and plating device, integrating ingredient measurement, temperature regulation, and moisture control functions into a mechanism designed to separate mineral components. In Escoffier's hands, it was a capable substitute for essentially any piece of kitchen hardware. It could even be used to create \"randomized cuisine\" by setting it to perform cooking steps at random.In fact, she often made use of this feature to generate ingredient combinations she might never have conceived of on her own. At times, these culinary experiments bore delicious fruit — though just as often, they produced results that were barely edible.The Self-Adapting Movement Signal Tracking Support Mek expanded the technical side of cooking by harnessing the power of \"prosthetics.\" It could be pre-programmed to perform a vast array of different movements that could then be executed following signals provided by Escoffier. Once installed upon her back, it was almost like a prehensile tail — whether manipulating utensils, handling ingredients, or carrying trays of food, it proved a steady and reliable assistant.If anything, this tail-like mechanism was sometimes too responsive, reacting to even the slightest movement Escoffier made. On such occasions, the light meant to indicate its operating status would start flashing in sync with its malfunctions.Had she known it would do this, she would have asked the engineers not to include an indicator light at all — so as to prevent the mechanism from betraying her emotions..."

    "text": "Compared to the blazing heat of an open flame, Escoffier is far more fascinated with the frigid cold of ice.When it comes to man-made technology, the requirements for cooling something down are significantly more demanding than those for heating it up.Low temperatures are key to locking in the original flavor of ingredients. The importance of preserving the freshness of food — both in the time between being gathered and being cooked and between being cooked and being served — is impossible to overstate.To these ends, Escoffier has tried everything to guarantee a stable supply of high-quality ice.The effects of Mist Flowers' freezing vapors are impressive, but they have a limited range of effect, and their cooling properties are a tad weak. The costs of using alchemical solutions are so vast that even the Hotel Debord wouldn't countenance them. Even the mechanisms of the Fontaine Research Institute cannot maintain artificially low temperatures for any significant amount of time...Escoffier once even traveled to the Dragonspine region to seek out a legendary \"Arcane Cryo Source.\"Wrapping herself in a thick coat and tightly wound scarf and carrying a heavy pack and an Iron Point, she wandered the mountain slopes for days.Even when her polearm had been worn beyond use, she still hadn't located her target. Suffering from severe frostbite and carrying wounds from repeated battles with the area's monsters, she had no choice but to leave empty-handed.On the long road back, Escoffier heard rumors of a mysterious Cryo entity known as Daleth, which only served to deepen her sense of regret. Her desire to find this source of Cryo would become a goal exceeded in intensity only by her obsession to advance the culinary arts.On another trip to Natlan in search of new ingredients, the stiflingly hot climate left her in some distress, causing her to take the wrong path and stumble into dangerous territory more than once.It never rains but it pours — just as Escoffier finally located the ingredients she was looking for, she carelessly disturbed a group of Avatars of Lava. Surrounded and in mortal danger, the scorching heat of burning Phlogiston almost caused her to faint. And even as she beat a hasty retreat, she was sent flying by an exploding barrel of Phlogiston.Up until this point, she had been desperately clutching her traveling pack, doing her best to protect the cooking mechanisms and ingredients inside. One thought kept reverberating inside her mind...Ice... Ice... Ice...Her memories beyond that point are hazy — as though she had inadvertently drunk a large quantity of spirits. All she could recall afterwards was that some... freezing current had washed over her from behind, flowing nonstop until the flames clinging to her clothes had been extinguished, and she had somehow left the monsters' territory behind.It was only once she had returned to Fontaine with the rare ingredients she had gathered that she discovered the Vision hanging from her back, radiating a cold brilliance.The residual shock of her near-death encounter was replaced with a sense of joyful astonishment. The euphoria that enveloped her utterly washed away the pain of her injuries.In order to maintain a sense of cold clarity, Escoffier secured her vision to her hairband, hoping it would calm her mind in the heat of the moment and help her retain absolute physical coolness in a kitchen roasted by roaring flames.With the help of her Vision, she finally managed to realize her dream of keeping her ingredients cool in all conditions. Not only that, but after learning to wield the elemental power it granted her, she combined it with the functions of her \"cooking mek\" to great effect, massively expanding the scope of her search for ingredients.Even her utensils benefitted — the knives, forks, and spoons she could now form from elemental ice were exceptionally durable, not to mention convenient to replace. Another advantage of Cryo-generated cutlery was that Escoffier no longer had to waste her time and energy carrying and washing silverware.And yet, despite being the most capable ice-wielding chef in all of Fontaine — perhaps even Teyvat — Escoffier produces surprisingly little ice cream.Perhaps one day she will devote her efforts to creating an entire school of cuisine based around it, crafting frozen treats that can be conjured up and enjoyed anywhere and anytime..."

It seemed to be drawn to Xiangling's cooking, as the creature started following Xiangling around wherever she went.Xiangling named it \"Guoba,\" after her favorite childhood snack."

Her specialty spicy dishes earned the praise of even her father, a veteran chef with over two decades of experience.She created her unique and complex flavor profile through a generous helping of chili peppers mixed with fruits and herbs for increased aroma. She also created what became the signature dish of Wanmin Restaurant: Black-Back Perch Stew, which combines the richness, color and strong flavors of Li cuisine with the fresh aromas and nutritional content of Yue cuisine.Some have tried to copy her recipes, but try as they might they can never quite reproduce the way her cooking tastes.\"Braise fresh Violetgrass overnight.

Sprinkle into any dish for an aromatic boost.\"This is one of Xiangling's secret recipes, arrived at through a painstaking process of trial and error.In Xiangling's case, that means countless bouts of diarrhea, countless bruised knees bashed on rocky cliffs, and countless wasted potfuls of food that didn't quite turn out as expected."

Gazing down from the top at the people as they passed by in the world below, Lyney knew there was no going back.<!--\n              -->Both the dazzling sleights of hand and the missions he would come to receive from Hotel Bouffes d'ete had made a habitual liar out of him.<!--\n              -->And while lies could sometimes be useful for seizing an advantage, they were more often employed to keep more people from being dragged into trouble.<!--\n              -->Lyney knew very well that once trust had collapsed, the scales of judgment would no longer remain impartial, and even noble goals would become twisted and thought of as evil.<!--\n              -->As such, not revealing more than was absolutely necessary was prudent when working with others. More often than not, this makes things go more smoothly, with everyone getting the results they want.<!--\n              -->But lies will not simply scatter on the wind, and Lyney must maintain this illusion with utmost care, all the while keeping his distance from those affected.<!--\n              -->As so the tower extended towards the skies, until there would be no one to take his hand if he reached out, and even their visages blurred in his eyes.<!--\n              -->Falsehood was Lyney's constant and only companion on the path that he walked, and this road was long and lonely — this he was always clear-minded about.<!--\n              -->Everyone knew the brilliant \"Great Magician Lyney,\" but they loved only the mystery, the romance, the unattainable nature. They knew no love for the heart that lay deeper within.<!--\n              -->He felt he had no right to pour out his mind to others, and yet he must carry on with gritted teeth, for the price of a fall from such heights was more than he could bear.<!--\n              -->Having played too many parts, even Lyney would sometimes find himself questioning who \"he\" really was.<!--\n              -->His dreams often took him back to the tower, where his resting place at the pinnacle vantage would grow smaller and smaller, and with the fog of death they called \"betrayal\" extending all around, there was nowhere for him to go.<!--\n              -->But just before he could plummet, a hand grabbed onto him — and from it, he felt a familiar warmth that drew his soul back into his body, steadying \"him\" within himself once more.<!--\n              -->\"Thank you, Lynette...\"<!--\n              -->The awakening youth mumbled to himself."

    "text": "While Hotel Bouffes d'ete's operations in Fontaine work toward a just cause, its methods can often be radical. Only the influence of \"Father\" and her control over the inner workings of the Court of Fontaine prevent any serious incidents from occurring.<!--\n              -->There was once an official funded by Lyney who served in the Maison Gardiennage. This person provided both intel in support of the Hotel's operations and scrubbed clean the effects of some of the Hotel's clandestine actions.<!--\n              -->These were actions that came with no small risk, but the official always performed them well, for he believed that the Fontaine of the present day needed someone like \"Father\" who could bypass the many layers of laws and regulations and take direct action.<!--\n              -->Lyney once joked to him: \"I'll be there if you ever need help, and if you're in danger, I'll come to rescue you... Well, don't expect too much of that last bit. Just stay on guard, alright?\"<!--\n              -->The official knew that this was Lyney's way of expressing concern, of course. Yet even words spoken in jest could prove prophetic later, and so they did — this official's deeds were eventually discovered, and on the brink of capture, he used an emergency communication device to send a message to Lyney.<!--\n              -->Upon discovering the device, the Gardes who arrived at the scene mocked the official's naivete, claiming that the signal sent merely informed his compatriots to save themselves — no one would be stupid enough to try to save him.<!--\n              -->The official's reply was also quite simple — even such an ending would have been fine for him, for he did not believe that his prior cooperation was the wrong decision.<!--\n              -->But just as the Gardes were about to arrest the official, thick smoke began billowing forth from dispensers pre-planted nearby, and the official caught sight of a brilliant blaze—<!--\n              -->The next moment, he was in the drink in the Fleuve Cendre, and was rescued by Freminet.<!--\n              -->It was said that the Gardes spent a great deal of time chasing after the skyborne flame-trail, believing that the criminal must have used some flying machine to flee the scene, only to discover later naught but wood dressed in clothes, affixed to a glider.<!--\n              -->In truth, Lyney had earlier used this device to draw the Gardes' attention away before getting the official out of his predicament.<!--\n              -->The official admitted that he had not had high hopes when pressing the device. Magicians were untrustworthy, after all — but still, he had chosen to gamble on that tiny chance.<!--\n              -->\"Haha. Well, it is indeed a gamble to place your trust in others.\"<!--\n              -->\"But don't worry. Magicians might be full of hot air, but we will never betray the expectations of our audience.\""

    "text": "There is a special entity amongst the cats adopted by Lyney and Lynette, and its name is \"Rosseland.\"<!--\n              -->Every cat in the Hotel has its own territory, but Rosseland has a special affinity for Lyney's hat.<!--\n              -->A hat is a magician's most important prop, and each time Lyney must use it, he must first chase Rosseland out — a difficult affair when its displeased meows in response are so heartrending, especially to siblings like Lyney and Lynette, who themselves once struggled to find a home.<!--\n              -->Thus the siblings began their search for a replacement, only to be met by refusal each time, no matter how lovely the new home — indeed, Rosseland would not even give them a second glance.<!--\n              -->Lyney even specially commissioned an identical hat, thinking that this might put an end to the cat's choosiness, only for Rosseland to lay claim that new hat also, becoming aggrieved no matter which was whisked away.<!--\n              -->But this was no feline tyranny. Indeed, Rosseland's requests were not terribly excessive. After much thought, Lyney eventually came up with a solution — to incorporate the cat into his magic shows.<!--\n              -->He and Lynette constructed a little puppet inside the hat that would normally serve as Rosseland's cushion. During performances, Rosseland would burrow inside the puppet, causing it to jink this way and that in a mischievous and adorable manner.<!--\n              -->And as it turned out, Rosseland was not at all shy — indeed, it greatly enjoyed its new job. Perhaps the spotlight brought it much enjoyment indeed, for it would never prove quite so predisposed to exclusive ownership again, even when it had to temporarily leave its nest when off-stage.<!--\n              -->During one of his shows, Lyney once made a rare error, having left a card he needed to produce on-stage backstage.<!--\n              -->With all eyes on him, he had mere seconds to think of a way to save the situation while maintaining his easy-going demeanor.<!--\n              -->But to his surprise, there was an unexpected weight in his hovering hat — it should have been empty, but Rosseland had somehow found its way inside.<!--\n              -->Out came the puppet, and out with it came the card Lyney had needed, to the instantaneous applause of all. Lyney heaved a sigh of relief, but he was also quite shocked, in truth.<!--\n              -->Some thought was put into this matter — but Lyney could only conclude that Rosseland had, influenced by the twins as it was, also mastered the art of the magical performance somehow."

    "text": "After Lynette gained the favor of the gods, the missions she had to undertake grew more dangerous and difficult.<!--\n              -->Only Vision-wielders like Lynette could fulfill the most dangerous missions while remaining completely anonymous, and the twins began to operate separately more often as a result.<!--\n              -->Lyney found himself unable to adapt to this. Not only had the siblings been together since childhood, but he knew that he was not the only one who felt disturbed by this split.<!--\n              -->He still desired to be beside her, lending her all the help he could — this was his non-negotiable desire.<!--\n              -->Knowing his desire for power was no longer pure, Lyney concluded that he had become undeserving of divine favor. Yet he still desired a means to bridge the vast gulf in strength between him and his sister, which he did not possess. Unless...<!--\n              -->To this end, he solemnly sought out \"Father,\" expressing his belief that he needed the mysterious and perilous might of a Delusion to operate alongside his sister.<!--\n              -->\"Father\" was silent for a long while, till at last two slanted crosses pinned him in place with a wrath rarely shown to the children of the Hotel, her gaze seeming to pierce his very soul.<!--\n              -->\"And would Lynette want you to do this?\"<!--\n              -->Her simple yet powerful question cut through the strings that bound his heart, and in a daze, his sister's words once more reverberated in his ears.<!--\n              -->\"No one needs self-satisfied concern.\"<!--\n              -->Lyney did not need to ask his sister to know that she would never accept his desire to stay by her side with the use of a Delusion. It was only then that he realized the absurdity of his wish.<!--\n              -->\"Father\" stood up and left, but not before reminding him that this was not the first time he had lacked power, but that he had found an answer before.<!--\n              -->Lyney would lock himself in his room, trying to digest the reasoning behind the words \"Father\" had left him with. When he and his sister had been out on the streets, the answer he had found then had been \"magic.\" What, then, would the answer be now?<!--\n              -->Lyney found the dossiers for all the missions Lynette had taken up during this period, carefully analyzing the process of each one and modeling his sister's every action.<!--\n              -->Was it really necessary to pass through this dangerous valley to get close to a target?<!--\n              -->Was it really a must to leap into such a swift river to flee the scene?<!--\n              -->No, this was just the Vision's light covering her.<!--\n              -->Thus did Lyney start to make comprehensive plans for his sister's missions, using his understanding of her to design the most suitable routes, make the most practical tools, and choose the best rendezvous points.<!--\n              -->The trust between them did not change. The look in Lynette's eyes when she left was no longer so strained, and they often embraced heartily and happily when meeting at the rendezvous point.<!--\n              -->The pure desire to protect one's family would not be moved, gods' favor or no.<!--\n              -->But even the best laid plans of mice and men may go awry. After conducting dozens of successful missions, the children of the Hotel were caught up in a betrayal, and as a result, Lynette's movements were exposed.<!--\n              -->Before the siblings was a towering cliff, just like the night when Lynette had gained her Vision — but this time, it was Lyney's turn to reverse their fortunes in a moment of crisis.<!--\n              -->He opened his emergency paraglider, and grabbing her, threw himself off the edge. But their pursuers followed, raining gunfire down on them.<!--\n              -->Lyney twisted this way and that, avoiding many a shot, but still the glider was punctured in several spots. Unable to maintain balance, they began to plummet downward towards the embrace of the ground below.<!--\n              -->Still, Lyney grit his teeth and refused to despair — should fate itself conspire to refute the answer he had come up with to protect his family, he would defy it to the end.<!--\n              -->Their pursuers began to snicker, knowing that a fall at such speeds would be fatal — only to have a flame light up the skies, pushing the stricken glider toward a fast-flowing river nearby.<!--\n              -->The power of Pyro changed the direction of their fall, while Anemo defended them from harm — and thus did the twin lights intertwine and spread under the moonlight, fading slowly like the applause that fills the stage during a curtain call.<!--\n              -->Lyney did not guess at the meaning of the shining Vision he saw in his hand. The answer was, after all, no longer important."

But she could have never expected that with a huge crash, she would forever be trapped between life and death.Whether adepti or demons, just or wicked, all understood that she was an innocent mortal caught in the crossfire.Or perhaps it was by the will of heaven that she received a Vision in her dying moments, and so ended this contention between adepti and demon.The adepti could not bear to let her die, and each imparted to her a portion of their strength, meaning to breathe life back into her body.Qiqi did indeed awaken and live again, but went into a berserk state, unable to control the adepti energy raging through her.Seeking to end the disturbance, Mountain Shaper had no choice but to seal the hapless maiden in amber."

The adepti have been with Liyue for millennia, but only a handful have ascended in the past three thousand years, which means that everything regarding the traditions now only exists in texts. This is not something one would likely witness twice in their entire lifetime.Not even the most particular and learned of researchers or scholars could find one fault in Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's ceremonies for sending adepti off.Everything must be perfect, from the costumes, the time, the place, the items, the weather, the scheduled length, the size of the permitted audience, to the stature, profession, and age of said audience.

The very money that circulates throughout Teyvat, Mora, is named after him.When night falls and bustling Liyue begins to slumber, he will sometimes stand atop the towering mountains and gaze upon this city, which he made with his own hands.To the people of Liyue, Rex Lapis has many divine titles.When he laid down Liyue's laws by his divine might, he was the God of Contracts. When he minted the first Mora and made Liyue strong by dint of commerce, the merchants revered him as the God of Commerce.He has lived through countless years and is the eldest of the Seven, and so historians call him the God of History.Thousands of years ago, the forebears of the citizens of Liyue Harbor struck stones together to start fires and used piled stones to create stoves. These blessings derived from the Geo element led the Geo Archon to gain the title of God of the Stove.People from other lands tend to call him Morax, though the people of Liyue prefer to use the term Rex Lapis.But in the hearts of lovers of opera and children, Morax's on-stage aspect, the all-conquering defender of Liyue — the Warrior God — is the most fascinating.The delicacies that Rex Lapis discovered while lost in the streets, the plaques inscribed with his handwriting, a famous opera that he once starred in, playing the part of a warrior... Many stories and tales of Liyue are, when studied closely, stories of people visited by their deity at some point — and the citizens of Liyue are most proud indeed of that history."

    "text": "As the founder of Liyue Harbor, \"contracts\" are the most important thing to Morax.From simple monetary exchange and agreements between merchants to the ancient laws that Morax himself laid down, there is no part of city life untouched by \"contracts.\"To merchants, \"contracts\" are the most important standard to which they hold themselves: deadlines, invoices, shipping destinations... Only a refined and strict order can sustain vibrant commerce, which is itself the lifeblood of Liyue Harbor.Thus the Qixing punish violators of such laws unceasingly, not only to uphold the divine rulings of Morax but also to allow Liyue to maintain its vitality.Through the millennia, every generation of the Liyue Qixing commits to interpreting the law, including subtle amendments to plug loopholes found in the law. Any loopholes that remain undiscovered are seen by the merchants as \"permissible if unaddressed,\" and they make killings off such holes until they are discovered and patched up by the Liyue Qixing.Amid this game of cat-and-mouse, the book that collates such amendments has reached a whopping 279 pages thick.The person currently responsible for maintaining this book, the Tianquan Ningguang, is secretly (and humorously) referred to as the \"Tailor of Liyue,\" in honor of her speed in patching these laws up, and for her sharpness of eye.But no matter how complicated or tangled mortal laws become, one of these stands above all others in the eyes of Rex Lapis.\"The one who reneges on their words shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock.\""

    "text": "Rex Lapis, most ancient of The Seven, has lived far too long.Rex Lapis still remembers that moment when the final archon took their divine seat, thus ending the Archon War and the era of warring gods. The Seven were a diverse lot and dispersed far and wide, but they all shouldered the burden of guiding humanity.As time passed, many of The Seven's titles changed hands, and only two remain of the first Seven: Rex Lapis and the Anemo Archon.The carefree Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, is the second eldest of The Seven.When Barbatos first came to Liyue, Rex Lapis believed his fellow archon to have encountered some terrible crisis in pursuit of their duties, thus requiring his aid.So when Barbatos descended in a gust of wind, the Geo Archon had already prepared himself to receive this neighboring deity and lend what help he may.But as he looked, the Anemo Archon tossed a wine bottle at him.\"Here's some wine from Mondstadt. Care for a taste?\"To forsake one's duty to deliver a single bottle of wine — what a preposterous notion!Yet the Anemo Archon kept coming to visit, to explore Liyue Harbor, all sorts of strange questions on his lips. The Anemo Archon's questions knew as little limits as the wine in his hands.From then on, the first Seven would often gather in Liyue.Rex Lapis still remembers how those wines tasted.The world has changed much since then, and all that was once familiar has faded into memory.The seven seats changed and again were changed, till five of the seven at the table were all departed.Nor would the duty of guiding humanity be honored by the new archons.Even the hardest rocks may be worn down after three thousand years.Nor would the wind ever return again.One drizzly day, the ancient ruler was strolling about Liyue Harbor, and overheard a merchant telling one of his workers,\"You've finished your duties, go ahead and call it a day.\"Long did he stand amidst the milling crowd.\"Have I... already finished my duties?\""

    "text": "During the Archon Wars, every corner of Teyvat was consumed in the fires of conflict. Not only did gods fight amongst themselves, but countless wicked things also sought to expand their domains.One such type of creature caused no end of woe for the Geo Archon, long before he took that title along with his place among The Seven.These foul creatures, straight from the murky depths of the ocean abyss, had a squishy exterior, and possessed agile tentacles that would live on even after being cut off, even secreting some thick and revolting fluid in the process.This alone would have been enough to make them the most monstrous of all creatures, and still it was not the pinnacle of their monstrosity.What made them so truly terrible was their small size, which gave them the ability to duck into unimaginably small nooks and crannies.No space was too narrow for them, neither the wooden boards of tables and chairs, nor the seams of windows and doors and curtain folds, nor even books and brushes.Many a poor soul had, on at least one occasion, unwittingly outstretched their hand, only to quickly retract it in horror with a blood-curdling scream at the sensation of something cold, clammy and damp, while one or more of these despicable creatures came crawling up their arm, leaving a shiny trail behind them...At the behest of the people of Liyue, Morax agreed to wipe these creatures out. But these parasites upon civilization could not be destroyed like enemies on a battlefield, by simply summoning a storm of stone spears that would shatter the earth and churn the soil{{sic|....|hide=1}}Still, he was the God of Contracts. His word had to be his bond.So, he went through the town from house to house with prisons of stone, seizing these creatures one by one and locking them away for good...This long campaign of pest extermination taught Morax the true meaning of \"a burden lifted.\"The grueling campaign itself, and the terrible smell of those ocean creatures' secretions, left a lasting impression on the deity.Today, even when he goes out incognito as the mortal man, Zhongli, Morax gives those living, squirming seafood products a wide berth....Well, except for dishes where said seafood products have been sliced and diced into oblivion, such as seafood tofu. He'll quite happily eat those."

He had been awarded a civilian commendation medal in recognition of his squad's efforts in repelling Abyssal creatures. The incident happened a long time ago. Though no one had stepped forward to organize it, the people wordlessly agreed to express their gratitude this way. The medal had been heavy, delivered to him in a timeworn box.\nConsidering how many casualties the operation had racked up, Flins did not think even ten medals could do justice to the losses. There used to be more of them &mdash; seven or eight in his squad &mdash; but now, only Flins remained, guarding the cemetery near the lighthouse.\nFor a moment, the crowd fell silent. The story brought to mind many things: The Wild Hunt, the monsters... as well as other memories that weighed heavily on the heart. Sorrow rendered them speechless. Some others had questions, and so they asked them, but Flins did not answer. He kept his head down, seemingly reminiscing.\nCompared to other Lightkeepers, Flins spoke with an air of elegance. He did not deign to answer questions about his origins or whether he had any siblings. Instead, he was more inclined to talk about distant, unrelated matters. He had a way of recounting events with perfect measuredness, just as in conversation, never excessive. The past, through his words, made listeners think to themselves: \"What an unforgettable tale!\"\nConsidering the vast majority of his audience lacked much life experience, many who listened to Flins did so out of curiosity. And it just so happened that his actions fit precisely this need. He invariably selected tales perfectly tailored for public retelling."

Though no one had stepped forward to organize it, the people had wordlessly agreed to express their gratitude this way, and so the heavy medal had been delivered to him, placed in a timeworn box.<!--\n              -->A solemn reward, one might think, but considering the casualties from that operation, Flins believed that not even ten medals could make the losses worthwhile. The squad once had seven or eight members, but now he was the only one left on the island.<!--\n              -->Apart from occasional business and the odd monthly purchase, Flins rarely shows up in town. Fortunately, this has not stopped the townspeople from remembering him, for he was easier to communicate with than they had imagined. Even his dull, boring clothes are made memorable by his elegant, decorous speech. No wonder people are curious — unexpected people and matters are always more eye-catching, after all.<!--\n              -->Most talk to him out of curiosity, albeit restrained by politeness. Curious about his past, people of all sorts have invited him to join gatherings to share old Lightkeeper stories. These he tells splendidly, such that many gazes have drifted downward when he reaches the saddening segments of said tales. This has led to many audiences not being willing to touch on his old scars any further.<!--\n              -->The residents revere Flins's occasional sorrow, unaware that this sorrow is another manifestation of distance — the audience's guilt becoming the teller's shield. Once someone feels this sympathy, the various narratives they have heard will take on meaning, convincing people that his melancholy deserves time and space. Whether out of courtesy or concern, no one should continue to pick at a good person's wounds, surely.<!--\n              -->No one despises the good people around them. The residents feel this way, and so does Flins. He is fond of those who are both interested and sympathetic, just as people enjoy the heroic tales he repeatedly tells. From another perspective, viewing each other as good people is an exceptional social strategy — a well-told heroic narrative is always dazzling enough to conceal all the mysteries that lie behind it."

Though there were many possibilities for who the visitor might be, he wasn't entirely without clues — the lonely island rarely saw visitors in general, so those willing to come by fell into a few categories: Those with unwavering determination, those seeking help, or those undaunted by trouble.<!--\n              -->Not many people fit these categories, so he could immediately think of the following individuals. First was Lauma, Maiden of the Frostmoon Scions, who had come bearing a Feast of the Moon a few weeks prior. Despite his repeated refusals, claiming a lack of preference for dining at home and no capacity for establishing faith, she had nonetheless spent twenty minutes speaking to him. Then there was Jahoda, an employee of the Curatorium of Secrets' lady boss. She affected the look of a capable sort while at the door, an image undercut by her having come because she had gotten lost upon arrival on the island — indeed, by Flins having already saved her from falling off a cliff, completely unbeknownst to her. Then there was Varka, who had never spoken of his profession but was widely recognized as a knight. That said, Flins's experience with him was most akin to that which he had with tourists, for Varka had once come to the lighthouse to borrow supplies after his luggage was knocked over in a battle with monsters near the island, and later came back by boat to return them. Finally, there was Illuga, a fellow Lightkeeper, a righteous young man who, worried that Flins might die alone on the island far from their headquarters and human knowledge, regularly brought various supplies and work documents to check on him...<!--\n              -->Flins opened the door to find an unfamiliar adventurer standing in front of the tower. Just the previous day, he had purchased a peculiar gemstone from this person at the general store. The seller had spent at least ten minutes spinning tales to drive up the price of the stone, but they had met their match — Flins was a dab hand at both gemstone acquisition and crafting stories himself. In the end, they settled on a price ten percent above market value, though the seller then hesitated, saying they needed some time to find a better box for the gemstone so it could be presented more elegantly to its new owner.<!--\n              -->The visitor appeared nervous and took a while before speaking: \"The shopkeeper said you've been collecting gems and ancient coins, so I must be honest about something. As you can probably tell, someone of my experience couldn't possibly obtain a gem of this caliber alone... According to my family's inherited notes, it was a gift from a noble to my ancestor, and it's extremely precious. I wouldn't be selling it if I weren't in financial difficulties. So, I'm feeling somewhat reluctant to part with it for good...\"<!--\n              -->Perhaps in their imagination, Flins, as the buyer, should have been angry at this point. So when he praised them instead, they were extremely surprised. A few minutes later, they had fully accepted that praise and left to continue their adventures, carrying both money and the confidence that they would surely make a name for themselves somewhere in the future. As for the previously discussed topics like \"You seem to know about this gem, Mr. Flins, sir. Have you seen it before, then?\" and \"About that noble, sir, there isn't much written in my family's notes. Could you tell me more about it?\", the adventurer had already put them out of their mind.<!--\n              -->The story of the jewel itself was long and plain — little was lost by not hearing it. Besides, Flins did not want to talk about anything else today. He simply wanted to take a good look at this long-lost gem."

Illuga watched him curiously.<!--\n              -->\"Two glasses. I'm guessing they're both for me?\"<!--\n              -->\"Dear Young Master Illuga, you have traveled a long way. Is it not only natural that you should have two cups of water? Indeed, you may have a third, or even a fourth. The pot is full.\"<!--\n              -->\"Not going to drink any?\" Illuga asked.<!--\n              -->\"I'm not thirsty.\"<!--\n              -->Illuga continued with this topic, as if there were nothing more normal in the world: \"You never get thirsty easily, and drinking alcohol seems more like a ritual than an interest to you. Could it be that you prefer drinking plain, tasteless water?\"<!--\n              -->Of course not, Flins thought. He detested tasteless water the most. However, he maintained his composure, brought over chairs, and they sat side by side in front of the lighthouse, basking in the sunlight.<!--\n              -->\"Last month, my colleagues asked me if you dislike sunlight, since you only seem to be active at night. They also asked when the last time you contacted the old man was. Also-also, why does everyone say they never see you come by, yet we hear that you not only visited but left without a trace?\"<!--\n              -->\"Well, now you can see me, just sitting here idly at the lighthouse entrance.\" Flins glanced inside the tower. \"My, you drink so quickly. My hospitality is lacking, it seems. Perhaps I should've brought you a whole bucket instead.\"<!--\n              -->\"It's been a long and tiring journey, as you said. Besides, if I didn't come running along every so often, this place of yours would wind up feeling too lifeless. And also, we need to sync up mission details with you.\"<!--\n              -->\"These words don't quite mean what they appear to, just like this 'they' you speak of may not even exist. All these questions are ones you wish to ask, in truth. Isn't that right, Young Master?\"<!--\n              -->\"Heh. Alright. Let's go with this one, then. Why do you call me 'Young Master'?\"<!--\n              -->\"You're clever and capable, and you know how to ask questions in a roundabout way, wrapping your curiosity in such politeness that no one feels offended. Your social graces would do nobility no shame, and so you've earned a suitable title.\"<!--\n              -->\"And if I'm a Young Master, what kind of person would be called a Lord? Please tell me more about that noble story you didn't finish last time, sir.\"<!--\n              -->\"Alright. Last time, we spoke of the era when the Belyi Tsar yet ruled, when the nobles were besotted with their balls and banquets. In those days, sociability was a currency most sought after. Such events not only exposed people to new knowledge, but also provided opportunities for, amongst other things, treasure and fine wine to be purchased. There were always some at the edges of this merrymaking who never danced, and they were more often not those here to find something special. Amongst such people were many whom one might call 'lords.'\"<!--\n              -->\"Why do those social occasions you mentioned sound like some resale market?\"<!--\n              -->\"And why would it not? The attendees are the same old faces. Friends might be second-hand, dance partners too, and antiques likewise. And grand gestures are not necessarily needed to acquire treasure. One could bet on how many rounds it might take for a person to get drunk, and win an item from some collection for betting well.\"<!--\n              -->\"And what would that reward be?\"<!--\n              -->\"Who knows? People tend to see only what they wish to, and everyone names different prizes. However, the day prior, someone claimed that his ancestor had once attended the Deepwinter Cocktail Ball — quite the distant event, that. He then made a bet with a noble lord of the fae who had little interest in the party, wagering that a dancer would get drunk before they had emptied their fifth cup. He won, and thus obtained a gem from said noble lord, who rather admired those of keen intellect.\"<!--\n              -->As he spoke, Flins gestured for Illuga to look at his palm. A brilliant ice-blue gemstone lay there.<!--\n              -->\"...I'm guessing you just received this.\"<!--\n              -->\"What a fine piece of merchandise it is.\"<!--\n              -->\"Call me an overthinker, but I get the feeling that your pile of stories is being prepared for second-hand resale at some point.\"<!--\n              -->\"Dear me, no. I would not sell it for money, no matter how dire our organization's financial straits. In any case, I doubt it rates too high in your eyes, Young Master.\"<!--\n              -->\"If it were so valuable, would that noble truly have given it away? Or are you suggesting that the fae nobles of Snezhnaya were so high-minded that they would all accept defeat with grace?\"<!--\n              -->\"Hard to say, I fear. But a noble who valiantly honors their word could never have been too evil.\" Having said this much, Flins gestured toward the inside of the door. \"I really should bring that bucket over, Young Master. You look like the phantom of one who died of thirst.\""

    "text": "If you were curious and observed all this, you would inevitably wonder... Was Flins telling the truth? The answer is no. But when asked if he was lying, the answer would, surprisingly, also be no. That which he spoke of, rather than a lie, should be considered a legend of which not all was told. For protagonists of legend, though marvelous in deed, did not always leave behind names.<!--\n              -->Let us return first to the time of the Belyi Tsar and that ball. The fae noble who showed little interest in the banquet and ultimately gave the jewel away on the pretext of losing a bet was named Kyryll Chudomirovich Flins. The recipient was Sokolov, a complete nobody from southern Snezhnaya, whose descendants would later become members of the Adventurers' Guild. The only connection between the two wholly unrelated parties was the \"Tear of the North,\" said to have been formed from the courage of Snezhnayan soldiers fighting in the northern territories, capable of protecting its bearer. Kyryll received it in the days when the Tsar bestowed many gifts upon the nobles, and after he gave it away, Kyryll himself vanished without a trace.<!--\n              -->Local legends have it that the noble who vanished — Kyryll the Azure Flame — was originally a blue flame that guided fallen souls across the icy plains. A flame will eventually go out, and while Kyryll did not stay at court for long, he was present for the transition of power from the Belyi Tsar to the Tsaritsa. There are only so many reasons for his departure: Dissatisfaction with the Tsar, or with the Tsaritsa, or perhaps he said something he shouldn't have and was purged for it. Some even say that his disappearance has nothing to do with politics. That his fire simply went out, having reached the end of its natural lifespan, and thus was never seen again. Not everything has to do with politics, so such people say. Could anyone put a number on the happenings at court, in any case?<!--\n              -->Kyryll Chudomirovich Flins's family crest and surname remain in the register of Snezhnayan nobility. He once was a member of the royal court, but never had any followers of his own. Gradually, the flames of Snezhnaya were completely replaced by red ones, and the regions that once enshrined blue flames also fell one by one. People eventually accepted the red flames burning across the icy plains, just as they accepted the new regime.<!--\n              -->Flins the Ratnik had once heard these tales of Kyryll. He clapped his hands, praising the mystifying atmosphere that had to be created to set the stage for a legendary tale, claiming that hearing interesting stories was one of his driving motivations for collecting ancient coins and gems. He has never been stingy with showcasing his collection, and indeed, Nikita, chief of the Lightkeepers, has had the fortune of viewing it before. But Flins often says that the collector's hobby is not expensive. People think so because they only see the shocking prices the most famous gems fetch, without realizing that those are the rarest of specimens — the vast majority command no such great sums.<!--\n              -->Take the \"Tear of the North\" from the story, for instance, which happened to be in Flins's possession — a happy coincidence, of course. It was beautifully transparent, yes, but it lost out to a still more storied gemstone due to its lack of added value. The recipient, Sokolov, had considered selling it, but couldn't get a good price. The gem had then passed through who knows how many generations before finally fetching a decent sum.<!--\n              -->As for Kyryll, the noble repeatedly mentioned in the tale... Well, were there ever such a noble, he most likely departed due to displeasure with the regime change. Where he had gone was of little importance to the people of this world. Legend has it, after all, that Snezhnayans held no one to be indispensable save the Tsar and Tsaritsa in those days. So if Kyryll were at divergence with some policy or another, departure was perhaps his best option."

    "text": "Time slows to a crawl during the night watch. With nothing else to do, the Ratniki guarding the camp gradually developed a habit of passing the time with cards and chess. When Flins came to submit a report to the sergeant major, he happened upon comrades of his gathered together, not yet asleep. He stood at the side and watched, a look of great interest on his face. After more than an hour, his colleagues finally noticed someone in the darkness besides them. After recovering from their shock, they decided that their lighthouse-keeper colleague must not be skilled at cards and enthusiastically offered to teach him over a few rounds. Flins played the part every well-mannered, reserved card game novice should — first declining, then taking a seat at the table, performing curiosity and restraint with utmost authenticity.<!--\n              -->Although the Ratniki invited him to play, they had no intention of going easy on him. As far as they were concerned, it was perfectly normal for a newcomer to lose a few rounds at the card table. However, what happened next was quite strange. Whether novice or veteran, everyone seemed to lose their sense of judgment that night. Their battle set the scoreboard ablaze, deadlock reigning over all as the game dragged on.<!--\n              -->This Flins was a fine fellow Ratnik, certainly, but how could he hold out for so long without losing? The veterans frowned, quietly gathering behind him to peek at his hand. But at that moment, Flins, his mask of sincerity flawless, played two somewhat subpar cards even as he praised card games for \"testing one's tactical acumen.\"<!--\n              -->At this point, his colleagues finally breathed a sigh of relief. He'd lost! Well, losing to Olav was no surprise. But he'd played decently earlier. Could it be that he wasn't a beginner after all? Who were his usual card game partners in that case? The frogs, stones, and spirits lingering by the lighthouse?<!--\n              -->Flins stood up to shake hands with his opponent, the apologetic look on his face seeming far from feigned: \"Mr. Olav, I accept my defeat wholeheartedly. Your card skills are truly remarkable, and although this was just one game, your spirit and demeanor speak for themselves. If you ask me, it's already a great honor that you were willing to play against a novice like me.\"<!--\n              -->\"Really?\" Olav happily stepped forward and firmly shook his hand. \"That wasn't an easy win, I must say. Your luck was truly formidable.\"<!--\n              -->\"How else could I have survived until now?\" Flins spoke subtly, with just a hint of sorrow in his words. Everyone then recalled that brutal battle, and they patted him on the shoulder, comforting this brother who must surely have once had to mourn his fallen comrades alone in the dead of night.<!--\n              -->\"Brother, take this deck of cards with you. We'll keep a seat for you, too — come back and play with us when you have time,\" his colleagues said.<!--\n              -->\"I'm afraid this pastime does not entirely agree with me.\" Flins smiled politely, but accepted the gift nonetheless.<!--\n              -->He stayed quite late that night, and when he left the next day, a misty pink hue hovered on the horizon. Olav saw him off, and there they happened to run into Nikita and Illuga, who were returning to camp after completing their mission. Flins stopped beside them with his lantern, nodding respectfully.<!--\n              -->Nikita glanced at Olav and understood at once: \"Played cards together, did you?\"<!--\n              -->\"Indeed. Just joining in the fun, you see. I was given a deck of cards, too — would you be up for a game, Illuga?\"<!--\n              -->\"Next time at the lighthouse, probably.\" Illuga smiled. \"You know, Dad was just saying he hasn't seen you in a while, by the by.\"<!--\n              -->Nikita suddenly asked Flins, \"Did you learn anything?\" Standing off to the side, Illuga thought this question was abrupt, yet interesting. What could a card game reveal? Had Olav been slacking off? In his mind, Flins, who had never been the sneaky sort, was suddenly more mysterious than any ghost. How could there be a Ratnik who had never played cards before?<!--\n              -->Flins lifted his lantern, the blue flame illuminating Olav's face. For the first time, Olav suddenly found something strange: The flame in Flins's lantern had always been cold blue, yet he had never seen anyone else purchase a similar one. What kind of fuel did Flins use?<!--\n              -->\"Mr. Olav, I believe, is a most patient and composed gentleman. He never once complained about my slow card play, and I suspect he's quite the skilled hand in the field. Using stillness to overcome movement, steadily achieving victory... Such traits surely manifest beyond the realm of card games.\"<!--\n              -->Ah, Olav thought, deeply moved. Surely Flins meant what he said — a dab hand at identifying others' strengths, indeed.<!--\n              -->Nikita looked at Olav earnestly, bringing to his mind the last time they had such a conversation. They had been discussing work assignments, and Nikita had suggested that he take up the challenge of becoming a squad leader.<!--\n              -->\"Even someone who's only played one game of cards with you says so, Olav. You should have more trust in my judgment, no?\" Nikita said.<!--\n              -->A comical situation often arises when many people discuss the same thing, where those who know each other too well are, in fact, less likely to adopt each other's suggestions wholesale. At such times, an unfamiliar voice's interjection can simplify matters. This was one such moment — for Olav now grew in confidence. Nikita was right, surely. Why wouldn't he be an excellent tactician? After all, even Flins, distant as he was at his lighthouse posting, could see that.<!--\n              -->Nikita visited the lighthouse a few days later. He had come specifically to thank Flins. Olav had always lacked that last bit of courage needed to push forward, and Flins's loss at cards had proved most fortuitous.<!--\n              -->\"You did me a favor.\" Nikita brought him some supplies. \"Take these. Even if you don't need them, they can help you keep up the pretense.\"<!--\n              -->\"Pretending might just become my favorite thing to do.\" Flins took out the cards his colleagues had given him. \"Interested?\"<!--\n              -->The card game proved a drawn-out affair. Nikita struggled mightily, while Flins was clearly enjoying himself.<!--\n              -->\"I hope my gratitude is evident. I mean, I'm even playing against a former noble in a card game his people excelled at.\" Nikita smiled wryly. \"Which is harder, then? Winning at cards or pretending you can't win?\"<!--\n              -->\"Both are easier than pretending to be an ordinary person.\" Flins played a card. \"Sorry, I win again.\""

    "text": "Kyryll Chudomirovich Flins is a fine name. \"Kyryll\" might be used to claim some noble standing worth noting, while \"Flins\" is not so ancient and not too special — all the better to claim mere coincidence should anyone notice some shared nomenclature. The person himself is most pleased with this name and has used it in various ways up till the present.<!--\n              -->The noble Kyryll did indeed leave Snezhnaya. The wise believe that there is nothing new under the sun, and tales of nobles choosing self-imposed exile when powerless to change the political picture are old hat indeed. To say that Kyryll has lived twice is no boast either. If one views sleep as death, and awakening as new life gained... This, too, is nothing new.<!--\n              -->His slumber began in a corner of a distant land. His self-imposed exile had set him free, and having lost his anchor, he traveled southward along the railway, through endless snowy plains, through prosperous towns, and across desolate frontier lands. He was without a care — he had no destination, nor anything he had to do.<!--\n              -->The humans passing him by were quite the opposite. As latecomers to Snezhnaya, they had too many desires to fulfill in a few mere decades of life. They were always in a hurry, planning out better lives and hoping to achieve great things in this new era. But Kyryll had long felt that he might not belong to such a time.<!--\n              -->It was under the lighthouse on a small isle that Kyryll the Azure Flame found his destined tomb, though one might also call it a bed to his liking, or a most lovable coffin. He had never intended to end his own life, merely to casually toast this monotonous world once, then go to sleep. He recalled the cocktail parties of yesteryear, of his noble colleagues gathering to discuss some passe questions. At the time, most fae lamented the transfer of imperial power, and wished for some river of youth springing eternal that might preserve the authority of Snezhnayan imperium forevermore.<!--\n              -->They spoke of immortality and eternity with longing and envy in their voices, much like how humans would discuss their fae lives. Kyryll was unsure as to how he had responded then, but he might have said: \"To never again fear anything — how could such serenity possibly exist within the confines of a finite life?\"<!--\n              -->Atop a stone altar, Kyryll transformed into a ball of fire and sank beneath the earth, beginning a slumber that would last hundreds of years. As his eyes closed, a thought suddenly came to mind: If he never returned to the mortal realm, and instead stretched himself infinitely within his finite time through self-imposed exile, then this sleep would become eternity. Hah. Eternity, precious beyond price, found by one who had cast himself out. Imagine that.<!--\n              -->Kyryll's slumber was no trivial matter. He made thorough preparations for it, selecting stone slates and laying down an altar, sealing himself in using the most ancient rituals. No mean price would it take to reawakening this flame, and its location, rarely visited by humans, made it less likely to be disturbed. However, this foolproof tranquility, this death-like slumber, ultimately vanished in the thunder of a rainy night.<!--\n              -->The soft sound of blood splattering upon the paving, the dull noise of metal cutting through flesh, the din of sharpened claws piercing bodies and striking against stone slates... Kyryll could not help but be awakened. Though hundreds of years had passed, his hearing remained as sharp as ever.<!--\n              -->Above his resting place, a unit of those named Lightkeepers battled the Abyssal Wild Hunt. Newly awakened from his deep slumber, Kyryll was indifferent to this. Not a single tongue of outer flame flickered. Had he been in human form, he would not have been seen to lift even an eyelid.<!--\n              -->That was a moment the Snezhnayan rumors mocked. \"Souls wandering the ancient frozen earth shall ultimately be guided to the far shore by blue ghost-fires.\" Even with his eyes closed, Kyryll could witness that scene: Warm human blood seeping into the stone altar, like some grand and ancient ritual. A mortally wounded warrior, collapsing upon the sacrificial sanctum and tracing the symbols on the stone slate with fresh blood. The warrior understood nothing of the fae script written upon it, nor could a person at death's door confirm if the lifeline before them was timely come or not. So with his final breath, he prayed, beseeching any who could hear to descend upon this place and scatter the storm-cloud of death and despair rolling toward them.<!--\n              -->Kyryll must have smiled at that moment. The fears the nobles harbored had, in the end, borne fruit. How could such a lasting dream exist in this world? Blood and souls had paid the price, and the azure flame was now reawakened. This should have been a grand, glorious moment, but the moribund supplicant knew it now, nor the distant monsters or the deceased. Indeed, most who would recognize that blazing fire had themselves passed on long ago. Such was the end of Kyryll's slumber, of which he had expected much, in this silent place of death.<!--\n              -->A colossal blaze scorched the skies as it erupted from the small island.<!--\n              -->How could serenity possibly exist within the confines of a finite life? Only death, glimpsed through the blue flames, is real."

Flins had a brilliant gemstone pinned to his solemn, dark outer clothing, an all too eye-catching accessory in that tiny shop. Illuga's first glance thus fell not on the man himself, but on the gem.<!--\n              -->\"Mr. Flins, you must have quite a sum in savings. Otherwise, such a gem must've been hard come by indeed.\"<!--\n              -->\"Oh, this? I got it at an auction. It just looks pretty. Remember the story I told you? Some gems are all show and no substance — they can't fetch a high price at all.\"<!--\n              -->\"Did no one bid against you?\"<!--\n              -->\"Well, most people don't know a good thing when they see it, for which I am grateful. There'd be no need for me to attend auctions otherwise, I suspect.\"<!--\n              -->\"Well, all the less reason to believe you don't have savings. Might you have had a distant relative who left you a large sum of money?\"<!--\n              -->Flins's face grew grave. \"I hope you can keep this a secret, good sir. This must not be revealed to anyone, especially to our colleagues.\"<!--\n              -->Being kind-hearted by nature, especially in front of others, Illuga felt proud to keep his colleague's secret and readily agreed. However, months later, Illuga found himself quite troubled by the sense that he had been completely taken for a ride. The city auction house claimed that they had never seen a gem of that description before, and that Flins had not attended one of their events in quite some time.<!--\n              -->\"You spun me a yarn, didn't you, Mr. Flins? The auction house says that they haven't had any fine gems come in recently.\"<!--\n              -->Flins raised his pot of water. \"First, have a little water to cool your temper. I never expected you to go ask around.\"<!--\n              -->\"Should I say that you consider me a friend, or that you don't... Either way, not every secret shared is the truth.\"<!--\n              -->\"Is it gemstones you'd like, then? Perhaps my distant relatives still have some in stock.\"<!--\n              -->\"I'd like to give my old pops Nikita a valuable gift. He's taken good care of me since I was little, you see,\" Illuga confessed.<!--\n              -->\"Now, that might take some time, but I suspect you will obtain something similarly good sooner or later. Having distant relatives come forth with gifts... That sort of thing will likely happen to you, too.\"<!--\n              -->Thus it was that Flins shared the true origin of the Moon Wheel with a cup of water and moonlight at night, a thing he rarely did. It had come to him on a night like any other, appearing suddenly in his showroom. At first, he, like Illuga that day, believed that this might be some gemstone he had forgotten about. In truth, it was the best gift the world had ever given him.<!--\n              -->\"An unexpected gift,\" indeed. Its style perfectly matched his coat, provided the perfect cover for his power and flames, and served as a conversation piece to share with colleagues as the sun set.<!--\n              -->As to whether Illuga believed his words, or when he might gain a \"gemstone\" of his own... Well, that was up to this up-and-coming young fellow to figure out — slowly does it, and all that."

As such, more than a few curious souls have signed up to unleash their inner strength. However, when they first lay eyes on this \"world-renowned coach,\" it's not uncommon for aspiring athletic acolytes to feel cheated and ask for their money back.\nSuch situations fill Iansan with a sense of helpless exasperation. After all, even she has to admit that it's hard to draw connections between her child-like physique and notions of \"strength\" and \"power.\" For many, it's difficult to imagine how someone so diminutive could guide them to \"break free from their weak and feeble selves.\"\nWhenever this happens, Iansan invites prospective students to name a fitness activity of their choice, challenging them to compete against her. Still smarting from being \"cheated,\" it's rare that anyone refuses this opportunity to take their anger out on some fitness equipment.\nThen, once her erstwhile inductees have exhausted themselves trying to outdo her, Iansan picks up their discarded weights and racks up a dozen or so more sets by herself.\n\"How is that even possible? Elemental power? A blessing from the heavens?\"\n\"No, my strength comes from a well-scheduled workout routine, controlled caloric intake, and precise supplemental nutrition.\"\nEven after experiencing defeat in this manner, many trainees still harbor doubts over Coach Iansan's words, but most of them still sign up for her academy all the same."

As tall — or short — as a child, the young lady in question is positively scrawny when compared with most of her peers.This young lady — whose unimposing frame gives the impression that a strong gust of wind might well blow her away — is the head coach of the fitness club at the Collective of Plenty: Coach Iansan.At first, many visitors had assumed that the tribe were merely playing a trick on outsiders.But in due course, there was ample opportunity for newcomers to witness Coach Iansan directing training sessions — and the aftermath, with her students collapsed exhausted on the floor while she herself had hardly broken a sweat.Eventually, with the eyes of all Natlan watching, Iansan proved her prowess on the greatest stage, setting an all-time victory record in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame.And now, Iansan is widely recognized as the gold standard for trainers in Natlan. She has even set up her own special training camp to teach the techniques required to attain victory in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame.Folk are shocked by Iansan's strength and curious as to its source. There are rumors that she has an unusual lineage, one which bestows her with extraordinary strength, but also uncommon shortness.Whenever outsiders to the tribe attempt to confirm these rumors with the Collective of Plenty, however, their questions are met by little more than icy stares and an equally frosty answer:\"Hmph, she trains hard.\"Having met their perfunctory burden of manners, the people of the Collective of Plenty will then return to working out, leaving behind befuddled outsiders who are unsure exactly what they did to cause offense.And so new rumors begin to spread, ones that claim Iansan's power is derived from a secret tribal weapon belonging to the Collective of Plenty — a weapon that they are forbidden from talking to outsiders about.Whenever such rumors begin to do the rounds, Iansan is quick to seek out the curious questioners.\"You too can be as strong as me. Join my training academy and I guarantee you results!\"Once their shock has faded, most people decline the offer. Perhaps they don't believe that Coach Iansan can really guarantee success, or perhaps they've already heard stories of just how grueling her training really is.The rumors surrounding Iansan continue to swirl and spread. On the rare occasions when she isn't training and has the time to pay them heed, Iansan can only sigh and shake her head.\"I keep telling them it's down to the training... Why doesn't anybody listen?\""

    "text": "For as long as she can remember, Iansan has known that she will never grow any taller.The \"Blood of Egungun\" runs through her veins, as it has through the veins of countless generations of her family. Her ancestors never grow to be taller than children.The tribespeople of the Collective of Plenty are the biggest and strongest in all of Natlan, yet Iansan and her family are anomalies. Their bloodline has thwarted all hopes of them ever becoming as formidable of stature as their tribal peers, while providing them with no obvious boon in return. Compared to the curse of their bloodline, even the tainted bargains of fairytale witches seem fair by comparison.Fortunately, the tribespeople of the Collective of Plenty are accepting and kind. After taking Iansan's family in, they have never treated them with prejudice, instead adopting a protective attitude. Whenever war broke out, Iansan's ancestors have always been kept from the front lines, serving as medics and cooks. They are not as courageous or nimble as the warriors of the tribe, having developed a habit of keeping their heads down and sticking to routine.Ever since Iansan can remember, she had helped her parents with their work. But compared with her parents' diligence, she had felt a persistent restlessness that seemed to call her toward the battlefield. Whenever she had the chance, she would always head toward the sound of the latest battle to await the returning warriors. Not that her waiting bore fruit — concerned tribal guards always returned her to her parents long before she could get near the fighting. It seemed that her fate was to follow in the footsteps of her parents and live the life predetermined for her by the \"Blood of Egungun.\"Until, that is, an unexpected event that shocked the whole tribe occurred — she was chosen by the ancient name \"Power\" to serve as its vessel.Iansan was as shocked as the rest of her tribe, but the inscription on the ancient name was clear beyond doubt. Overnight, Iansan became the center of attention, but most of the gazes that now fell on her were far from kind. For the Collective of Plenty, the ancient name \"Power\" was especially significant — representing unrivaled honor and unparalleled responsibility. Most of the tribe looked down on Iansan, both in terms of her ambition and stature. They questioned not only whether she deserved this honor, but also whether she could live up to its expectations.But those most troubled by this turn of events were her parents, who — despite their hard work — had always been content knowing their place in society. They knew they could offer no help to Iansan in this matter, and could not even speak of it for the longest time. When they finally broached the subject with their daughter, it was to express their unconditional support for whatever path she chose.And so, a few days later, Iansan approached Acatl — who was both the tribal chief and head coach of the Collective of Plenty's fitness club at the time.\"Coach, I want to train!\""

    "text": "In the Collective of Plenty, fitness is sacrosanct, second in importance only to the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. The tribespeople advocate for a universal focus on working out and take great pride in the results of their training.Despite this, when Iansan appeared at the hallowed tribal training grounds, there was much grumbling from her peers. \"This kid should quit before something happens,\" many thought. After all, to most observers, Iansan working out wasn't a question of suitability, but one of basic safety — some of the weights being thrown around weighed more than she did!Her fellow fitness enthusiasts collected all the entry-level equipment they could and placed it in front of Iansan, explaining that it represented the threshold required to join the club. They thought this would dissuade her, but Iansan merely selected a small barbell and put all of her effort into trying to lift it. Before the plates had even left the ground, the gathered crowd heard the loud crack of creaking bones, and rushed forward to stop Iansan...It was weeks before Iansan could get out of bed and walk by herself, and even that was only due to her father's skills as a medic — otherwise, she might have been bedridden for months. Upon hearing that Iansan was getting better, Acatl paid her a visit. Ever since failing to stop Iansan from hurting herself, Acatl had been facing much criticism from the tribe. Iansan was worried that his visit was a personal attempt to persuade her to abandon her chosen path.\"So, fitness has a threshold?\"\"Fitness isn't a question of credentials, it's a question of choice.\"Acatl assuaged Iansan's concerns before telling her the story of the founder of the Collective of Plenty's fitness club.This great warrior, Meztcala, was once chief of the Collective of Plenty. He had a mighty physique and a strength seldom matched before or since. Back then, the tribe had experienced much upheaval since its founding and was yet to establish a firm foothold by the slopes of the Sacred Mountain. He used his prodigious strength to conquer monsters and magma alike, while protecting his people day and night. At that time, the Sacred Mountain had just entered a new eruption cycle. As volcanic activity became more and more intense, even Meztcala, strong as he was, began to feel tired and overwhelmed. In the face of growing pleas for shelter from his people, he knew he alone could not weather the storm, yet he never abandoned them.\"You can all become like me. You can all choose to become like me!\"He made the tribespeople his students, taught them his training techniques, and then led them against the dangers that threatened their tribe. Through countless grueling trials, the people of the Collective of Plenty learned that they too had the strength and power to protect their homeland. By the time Meztcala grew old and succumbed to the irresistible force of time, his students had surpassed him and now formed a protective barrier around their tribe. In the end, the tribespeople of the Collective of Plenty established a secure and peaceful homeland at the foot of the great volcano.\"That is the origin of our fitness club, and the words I just told you are a warning passed down by Meztcala himself. If anyone claims that training has a threshold, do you think he would agree?\"\"Iansan, I've heard about your troubles lifting even the most basic training equipment. This doesn't mean you lack the credentials to train, it simply means that everyone else lacks the ability to train you. Your physical condition is beyond the boundaries of practically any fitness trainee's personal experience. And so, it would be remiss of me not to point out that training, for you, will be a very difficult path to follow.\"\"However, the path you take is ultimately a choice that only you can make.\"After Acatl had left, Iansan lapsed into a multi-day silence, as she had when she first discovered her ancient name. Eventually, when she emerged from her solitude, it was to seek out Acatl once more.\"Coach, I want to train!\"With that, Iansan returned to the tribal training grounds. But this time, she was not met with a pile of weights and equipment designed as a deterrent. Instead, the members of the fitness club brought Iansan to a freshly prepared patch of ground, far from the dangerously heavy, swinging weights of the main workout area. In this space, they had prepared for Iansan her own personal place to train, complete with everything she might need.This time, their gazes contained more than just concern for her safety. Now, there was a hint of admiration as well — for they all understood that this young woman had actively chosen to walk a lonely path of training."

Yet her indomitable willpower did nothing to lighten the pain and soreness that frequently racked her body, nor the persistent injuries.In those days, a culture of competitive perseverance permeated the club, with members measuring their success by the levels of burning pain in their muscles. Many of the trainees preferred to chase improvement by challenging their absolute limits.Iansan's injuries were almost wholly brought about by trying to imitate this style of training.Once, while recovering from an injury, Iansan — hobbling on crutches — passed the packed training grounds and stopped to stare at the equipment. She suddenly realized that she no longer felt the excitement and enthusiasm towards the challenge these objects once presented, rather, she could only feel the aching pain in the joint she'd recently dislocated.That was the first time Iansan truly felt like she wasn't cut out for fitness training.After a week of staying inside and shutting out the outside world, Iansan's mother — torn by her daughter's obvious anguish — tried her best to comfort her.\"There are many ways we can't compete with others, but we have our own talents. For example... treating injuries and cooking food...\"Iansan's mother fell silent. If the experienced trainees at the fitness club couldn't help guide her daughter to success, what chance did she have, as someone who had never trained a day in her life? But to her surprise, the blazing fires of determination began to burn anew in Iansan's eyes.\"You're right. We can treat injuries and cook food!\"After a month of recuperation, Iansan returned once more to the training grounds. This time, she walked straight past the experienced trainees, who were flexing and flashing poses at each other, and straight past the piles of equipment that had so tormented her before. This time, she picked up a pot and began to train — moving around, taking notes, and cooking.Her training seemed far more leisurely than before. She followed her routine and completed a few sets of the same exercises each day. At the same time, she somehow seemed busier: as though every hour of every day had been planned out. She appeared to have lowered her expectations, rarely pushing herself close to her limits — unlike the other fitness club members. And yet, her expectations also seemed somehow to be more stringent, as she no longer missed a single day's training, all while cooking her own meals and strictly regulating her diet.After weeks of this strange behavior, people started to notice. Rumors began to circulate that Iansan had found the secret to overcoming the limits of her bloodline. They flocked to her unusual training sessions, and gathered around as though watching a piece of performance art...\"In the simplest of terms, my strength comes from a well-scheduled workout routine, controlled caloric intake, and precise supplemental nutrition.\"The curious onlookers dispersed, disappointed with Iansan's explanation. The philosophy she had described to them did not seem to offer even the slightest challenge. They couldn't fathom how something so simple could allow Iansan to break through the limits of her self.What none of them seemed to have noticed was that ever since shaking up her training regimen, all of Iansan's fitness metrics had been steadily improving — from running farther, to performing more pushups. Perhaps this was because the other trainees didn't care much for that sort of data, but to Iansan, these gradual improvements were solid and consistent, like steel folded over and over — each tiny milestone building towards a fundamental change.At that time, Iansan had no idea that she had already introduced a brand-new concept to Natlan — the science of nutrition. All she knew was that she had finally found a mode of fitness training that suited her individual needs."

    "text": "Iansan's friendship with her saurian companion stems from a tradition of the Collective of Plenty — the people of the tribe enjoy wrestling with Tatankasaurs, with victory in such contests being a mark of great honor. A little while after joining the fitness club, Iansan also attempted this feat, but try as she might, she couldn't so much as budge a single adult Tatankasaurus. Fearing that her attempts were likely to end the same way as her brushes with equipment at the training grounds, her more experienced peers introduced her to Emela. Emela had been orphaned not long after her birth, and was taken in by the tribe. She was a baby Tatankasaurus, and it seemed more fitting for Iansan to train with someone of her own size.One child had lost the care of her parents, and the other had been coddled a little too much by hers. There was a natural rivalry between the two — one that only intensified once they were assigned as training partners. They both poured everything they had into their first duel, one regretting how they had lacked the strength to protect their parents, the other wishing to gain the strength to protect her own. In the end, they both fell, exhausted, to the floor, with no clear winner left standing.From that moment on, their rivalry officially began.Once Iansan found a method of training that suited her, though improvements came slowly, she gradually managed to push beyond her limits. During that time, she was in the lead.But as Emela moved out from under the shadow of her parents' passing, she began to thrive in the light, until eventually, she surpassed Iansan, and had her eating her dust.By this point, Iansan's progress had gradually attracted the attention of the entire tribe. In an unexpected turn of events, she ended up defeating the chief of the Tatankasaurs and eventually took over from Acatl as the head coach of the fitness club.Emela's own progress was likewise exceeding everyone's expectations. She had long since grown larger than any other Tatankasaurus in the tribe, and rose to become their new chief.All the while, their rivalry continued. Both of them seemed desperate to constantly surpass the other, leaving their rival to play catch-up.Despite this intense competition, when they were not challenging each other in contests of strength, Emela would allow Iansan to ride on her back as they explored the wilderness together.Once the war to repel the Abyss invasion had ended, Iansan's students brought her to the place where Emela was buried. They felt a great sense of responsibility for the fact that Iansan had not seen her dear friend one last time before her passing.\"There were so many enemies, she must have known that she wouldn't return if she charged in... If you'd been there with her instead of us, you could have stopped her...\"\"No. If I'd been there with her, I would've charged, right by her side. We'd have raced to see who could reach the enemy first.\"Iansan laid down a flower for her old friend and uttered, for the first time, the unspoken rule that was at the heart of her and Emela's rivalry —\"Only by taking the lead can you protect the ones you've left behind.\""

    "text": "As the horns sounded to herald the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, Iansan returned to the Stadium of the Sacred Flame once more to set a new record for consecutive victories.People no longer questioned her credentials as the head coach of the fitness club, nor did anyone dare mock her unassuming stature. While others may express shock at her results, Iansan remained unmoved — she simply focused on updating her training plans and recipes, unceasing in the implementation of her fitness philosophy.What did surprise Iansan, was that everyone discussing her bloodline now suddenly expressed envy towards her \"gift.\" Most members of other tribes knew nothing of Iansan's family background, nor had they witnessed her hard work. Amazed by her achievements, they began to grasp for explanations. In the midst of this speculation, rumors abounded that the \"Blood of Egungun\" was a mark of innate power, one that bestows otherwise unattainable strength for the price of a lifetime of being unable to grow.Even more shockingly, Iansan's vanquished opponents readily accepted the truth of this \"gift,\" not only praising Iansan's talents, but also claiming it as justification for their losses.Only Iansan remained silent, her frown deepening at these rumors that she had at first ignored.Not long after, the trainees of the Collective of Plenty's fitness club began distributing flyers at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. Upon receiving these flyers, most people assumed they were invitations to some sort of tribal event, but when they read the contents, their mouths were left agape in shock...\"The Pilgrimage Victors Academy is looking for students! Any tribe, any age, any gender! You too can become a record holder with a winning streak!\"After confirming that these flyers did indeed come from Iansan, shock turned to confusion. By now, everyone knew about the \"Blood of Egungun\" — what sort of training could possibly help them overcome the disadvantages of their own unremarkable bloodlines? Everyone assumed that this must be Iansan playing a prank.But then Iansan appeared, both to deny the rumors and to hand out flyers in person. Some curious souls even visited the address on the flyers and discovered that Iansan had relocated the fitness club from deep within Collective of Plenty territory to a spot much closer to the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, seemingly in preparation for taking on trainees from other tribes.Not many were swayed by Iansan's flyers, but an intrepid few made their way to the newly relocated training grounds. Most of them were limited by their own physical shortcomings but yearned to become stronger, just as Iansan once had. The only difference was that these people had let themselves be held back by their own uncertainties. Iansan's guiding principle was to provide them with the motivation to move forward, while showing them the path.\"I won't deny it, talent is important. It decides how fast we walk on the paths we choose... but it cannot decide how far we can go.\"After a year of quiet persistence, these pioneering trainees emerged as outstanding competitors in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame — just as Coach Iansan had promised. Under her dedicated tutelage, countless students achieved their own breakthroughs, some of them going on to surpass even their coach's abilities.Even so, skeptics were still the majority, not that this caused Iansan much concern — more and more trainees were signing up for her academy. On her next round of flyers, she added a new line:\"You need not be born with power. Toil is what truly imparts strength.\"Iansan understood that by breaking through the limits of her self, she had already lived up to her ancient name, yet she still wished to push herself further. The line she had added was her personal footnote to the ancient name of \"Power.\" There would come a day when she would prove her philosophy to all of Natlan, just as she had already done with the Collective of Plenty."

    "text": "For a long time, Iansan's patterned skull has been something of an icon. It is said that its original owner was a Tatankasaurus who tragically died young. Perhaps Iansan keeps it to commemorate this unfortunate child.One day, a group of trainees — approaching from a distance — noticed Iansan training on her own. They were shocked to discover her skull grunting like a live Tatankasaurus. It appeared to be cheering her on.\"So... it's not dead?\"\"Oh, I still haven't introduced you all! This is Alaye, you can think of it as my training partner. It's a little shy, so usually it only speaks when no one's around.\"And so Iansan began to tell her astonished students the story behind her skull. One day, Iansan's saurian companion, Emela, came to ask her for help. Emela had encountered a Tatankasaurus spirit lingering over its remains, unwilling to journey on to the Night Kingdom. Iansan sought out the help of Citlali from the Masters of the Night-Wind and asked her if she could weave her magic with the Tatankasaurus's remains, much like creating a Tzitzimitl. And so, the Tatankasaurus spirit was bound inside its skull, where it would neither lose its way nor fade with time.When she had finished speaking, Iansan caressed the skull gently, as though comforting it.\"Whenever I'm working out, it gives me encouragement. It must have wanted to grow into a strong, dashing adult Tatankasaurus like its peers. That's why it wasn't ready to leave.\""

    "section": "Vision",
    "text": "Long before Iansan took over as head coach of the fitness club, an immensely heavy barbell had been given a place of honor at the center of the training grounds.It was rumored to have been left there by the original founder of the fitness club. Only someone who had attained the pinnacle of strength would be able to lift it, and doing so would cement their place as the new leading light of Natlanese fitness. As such, lifting this barbell was the ultimate goal of all the club's members. And yet, no one had ever succeeded.Whenever a new challenger would approach the bar, everyone would gather around to discuss — and wager on — the outcome. For the tribespeople of the Collective of Plenty, lifting this barbell was proof that one embodied the pinnacle of fitness. It was a challenge that everyone wished to pass, and one that garnered a huge deal of speculation as to who would finally be the one to do so.Then one day, Iansan herself approached the bar and stood there, lost in thought. Those nearby could see the yearning in her eyes and did their best to persuade her not to try.\"Do you know what sort of power it would take to lift this bar?\"There was doubt in their voices, but also concern. Everyone knew that if Iansan tried to lift the barbell, the resulting injuries would be far worse than any she had suffered when she first started training.\"It would take the 'Power of a Thousand Days'!\"That is how Iansan answered them.The gathered onlookers exchanged puzzled glances — none of them knew what the \"Power of a Thousand Days\" was. Most assumed it must be some new esoteric training philosophy Iansan was dabbling in. After ensuring that Iansan wasn't about to do anything that might hurt herself, the crowd dispersed. None of them had noticed the yearning in Iansan's eyes turn to a steely determination.For the first set of 100 days, Iansan trained as usual, repeating the same self-assigned routine of bland, boring exercises — nothing that would draw anyone's attention — persisting day after day, just as her ancestors had always persisted in their labor. Soon, everyone had forgotten about her words before the barbell and everything at the fitness club returned to normality.By the third set of 100 days, Iansan's training was finally showing signs of change. Perhaps because of the increased intensity, she was plagued by injuries during this time, yet shrugged each one off in short order. This may have been due to the healing skills she had acquired from her parents, or it may have been down to the unusual food she was cooking for herself. She was still sticking mostly to the same old exercises she had assigned herself — slowly grinding out set after set in an unnoticed corner and abstaining from displaying her gains like most of her fellow club members.By the fifth set of 100 days, the fitness club's members were flexing their muscles and discussing which of their peers needed to get back on the gains-mobile after taking it too easy for too long. This ebb and flow of effort was common at the fitness club, but as most members were familiar with dozens of different programs to get \"muscles in a month,\" it seldom took them long to go back to being ripped after a short period of slacking off.By the seventh set of 100 days, a few more observant trainees had noticed that something was different — not that they could pinpoint exactly what it was. It was only when a club member, who had been away from the tribe for over a year, returned and yelped out his surprise that a shocking revelation was made — Iansan was now using the same fitness equipment as everyone else! This change had taken place over the last several hundred days, so gradually that no one had noticed.By the ninth set of 100 days, someone finally stumbled across the training plan that Iansan had made for herself. Thinking back to her words from over two years ago, those who had persuaded her not to try lifting the barbell were no longer so certain. It was as though Iansan's months and months of silent grinding had pulverized their concerns into dust.By the final 100 days, the once-unnoticed corner where Iansan trained had become the focal point of everyone's attention. At some point in the preceding weeks and months, she had become the flexer-in-chief of the fitness club. The other members gathered around and gasped in admiration at her recent triumph over the chief of the Tatankasaurs. Not that Iansan paid them much mind — she was single-mindedly focused on steadily executing her training plan, keeping her head down, and sticking to her routine.When the thousandth day rolled around, almost three years in the making, Iansan finally returned to stand before the barbell. Everyone in the tribe with even a passing interest in fitness was there to watch, eagerly awaiting the miracle that was due to take place before their eyes. This time, no one was discussing the outcome — everyone who had witnessed Iansan's hard work over the preceding years already knew what was about to unfold.As Iansan approached the bar, to her surprise, she found a twinkling Vision hanging from it — who knew when it had been put there?Iansan understood this was proof that she was staring down the imminent fulfillment of her wish. Yet to her, this was just a \"target\" on her training plan. Perhaps, in Iansan's world, there was no difference between the two.Iansan removed the Vision and then lifted the barbell, with as much ease and certainty as if it was merely another item on her training plan."

They're the kind of people who can devour entire platters of grilled meat in one sitting. But at my size, I could never fit that much food in me, so I was already on the market for a more efficient way of meeting my nutritional needs. Since I was stuck at home recovering for a while, I borrowed some reading material to research various ingredients and started experimenting in the kitchen, trying to cook some meals to support my training goals. After several failed attempts, I finally found a recipe that worked for me, and it was game-changing. Not only did it speed up my recovery, it also helped me to break my bench press record.

The few commonly known alchemy techniques of today are but enough to put some broken odds and ends together, saving you the money you would have otherwise spent on glue. \"Nay, alchemy is not so ignoble an art!\" Or so most alchemists would protest. But as far as the average citizen of Mondstadt was concerned, that was alchemy. At least until the day Albedo suddenly appeared and decided to stay in Mondstadt. This young man displayed the true prowess of alchemy to all, bringing with him a massive corpus of wisdom that even the Sumeru Akademiya did not possess. \"The universe is heaven reversed, and the earth is a dream lost to time. This is dust, the most basic form of complex life.\" As if to provide evidence for this claim, Albedo lifted the burnt ash of the flower that once grew atop a Dendro Slime's head. Seconds later, a Cecilia sprouted forth from the ash in his hand. \"And this... is new birth.\""

Still, he does not have the strange and eccentric temper that people tend to assume of academics. In fact, he is earnest in all his dealings. He is, however, of the persuasion that it requires more energy to maintain relationships established on excessive enthusiasm. As a result, Albedo's equivalent of friendship involves maintaining an appropriate degree of distance. Whether shutting himself away to work or traveling and gathering materials, no one in Mondstadt knows how to find him. Albedo's tendency to avoid social interactions does not make him a cold-hearted person. He is sincere and contented when instructing his assistants, Timaeus and Sucrose. He finds pleasure in giving his sketches to the citizens of Mondstadt. Yet he cannot help but feel sincere disappointment that Lisa, for all her great talents, has chosen to remain a mere Librarian."

Nevertheless, Mondstadt's gates are ever open to all, and a recommendation letter is not strictly necessary. Indeed, it could be argued that Albedo's life would have been far more comfortable without the letter. This is because the recipient of the letter was the famed travel writer Alice, an old friend of Albedo's master, Rhinedottir. After receiving the letter, Alice considered its requests. \"So Rhine said that you'll need a laboratory... And not one of a size that a civilian could build, either. Hmm... I know!\" And just like that, she threw him into the Knights of Favonius. The work of the Knights is actually quite easy for Albedo — requiring only five percent of his energy. Albedo had imagined that the rest of his energy could be spent on experiments, with the Knights' full range of apparatus at his disposal. And yet... Alice had a daughter, named Klee. Yes, \"that\" Klee. \"We'll be a family from now on, treat her like a real younger sister!\" From that day forth, remedying Klee's disasters would come to take up most of Albedo's remaining energy..."

The chalk: that is you. The earth is where alchemy gets its name, and is the basis of all life.

Life was uneventful, its meaning consisted of nothing more than accompanying his teacher, doing what she asked of him, and meeting her expectations. But one day, deep in the heart of a dungeon, master and apprentice discovered an artifact known as The Heart of Naberius. And with that, his master disappeared, leaving naught but a note, a recommendation letter, and a classical text behind. Upon the note was written: \"Albedo, go to Mondstadt. Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Then, complete your final assignment.\" The classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum from his master's collection. If one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift — the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, a written acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him. In the past, Albedo's assignments had always been very difficult. He had always believed wholeheartedly that his master would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail. But this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities. Did this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his master again? \"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world.\""

    "text": "The alchemy that Albedo commands is wholly different from any of the arts practiced in the Seven Nations of Teyvat. Its lineage can be traced back to the nation of Khaenri'ah. Khaenri'ah was an underground realm, with precious few natural fauna. As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life. This art of creation was known as \"The Art of Khemia.\" Albedo had learned of this in his youth from reading his master's notes. The next stage after \"soil\" is \"chalk,\" which was also something his master had mentioned. \"Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man.\" Now, Albedo understands alchemy in far greater depth than he did in the beginning, and his knowledge on the subject is far more comprehensive. \"From soil was birthed chalk.\" The profundity of this statement is well understood by Albedo now. Such ineffable secrets are bound up with his fond memories of his master. She was not his birth mother, but there is no doubt that his life stems from her. \"I hope this isn't just wishful thinking, but... when parents speak to their children about 'the meaning of this world'... surely they just mean the pursuit of a happy life?\" From time to time, Albedo finds himself musing on this sentiment."

    "text": "Albedo's interest in drawing and painting began back in the days of traveling with his master. At first, he would simply illustrate his notes with basic sketches. But he soon noticed that the process of rendering things in great detail helped him to intimately understand their physical makeup, which was of great utility to his alchemical studies. Additionally, it also allowed him to enter into a pleasant state of clarity, in which he needed only to focus on observation and creating his artwork, and nothing else. Eventually, Albedo became a master artist without ever having received formal tuition. When strolling through Mondstadt, he enjoys sketching and painting all manner of living things, but particularly people in moments of joy. Sometimes, he even gifts his artwork to his unsuspecting models, believing that when a work of art captures a transient moment of enjoyment, it is something worth treasuring. Albedo continued to refine his skills in this manner, going from strength to strength — until one day, when he was taken aback by illustrations from Inazuma. How was it that drawings of such generality could possess such narrative power? Amazed, he decided to give it a go himself. ...Eventually, after collaborating with a certain novelist by the name of Xingqiu, \"A Legend of Sword\" was printed and published. Unfortunately, it received lukewarm reviews, being lambasted as \"a dictionary with divine illustrations.\""

They entrusted Klee to the care of Albedo and the Knights of Favonius.Though still small, Klee knew she would one day become just like her mother.One day, her explosives would become something that her mother would be proud of."

Master Jean told the people that this boy had once been a dragon. Through wondrous alchemy, he had gained a human form and now sought to learn how to live among them.<!--\n              -->A dragon turning into a human wasn't exactly shocking news. After all, countless fairy tales had sprouted from Mondstadt’s soil. What truly stirred the people's curiosity was the boy's name: Durin.<!--\n              -->Whenever that name was spoken aloud, people would instinctively look toward Dragonspine. Beneath its blinding snows lay the colossal bones of a creature long gone, and with them, memories of a calamity best left buried. For most citizens of Mondstadt, that name carried not wonder, but unease.<!--\n              -->Still, with Jean and the Knights of Favonius vouching for him, Durin was welcomed into the city all the same.<!--\n              -->People began to see him everywhere in the city, and they soon discovered that in truth, Durin was the more timid one in every encounter. He was curious about everyone, yet preferred to watch from afar, uncertain and hesitant to draw near. Whatever dread his name once evoked, the boy before them had no share in it.<!--\n              -->Little by little, the people of Mondstadt grew used to Durin's presence. Their wary glances softened, and daily life returned to its peaceful rhythm. In time, when they spoke his name again, many no longer looked toward the white peaks. Instead, they thought of a gentle boy — one who blushed as he asked Flora in front of Floral Whisper which flowers might best suit a friend, or who stood outside Good Hunter, embarrassed yet earnest as he asked how not to burn the meat. Bit by bit, those gentle scenes washed away the memory of that old disaster. The name \"Durin,\" once spoken of in fear, no longer made anyone flinch.<!--\n              -->It felt, in a way, like rewriting the ending of a sorrowful tale, right from its very beginning."

Hundreds of years ago, when the catastrophe from Khaenri'ah spread across the land, an evil dragon named Durin descended upon Mondstadt, leading a horde of Abyssal creatures in its wake. Its very existence was a disaster — with a single breath, it could turn fertile plains into barren wastelands. Guided by Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, his familiar Dvalin took to the skies above the snowy mountains to face Durin in a fierce battle. In the end, Dvalin tore open Durin's throat and brought the dragon down. Yet Dvalin, too, was tainted by the venomous blood, and remained so until recently...<!--\n              -->All in all, it is a rather tragic tale.<!--\n              -->In the days following that great calamity, a certain poem quietly circulated among the bards of Mondstadt:<!--\n              -->\"Mother, as you bade me, I have come to this land to show everyone my beauty.\"<!--\n              -->\"The flowers here are fragrant, and the wind is gentle. I run with the breeze, and the blossoms bloom brighter in my wake.\"<!--\n              -->\"Butterflies flutter around me, as if in awe of my beauty. Yet when I reach out to them, they always shy away.\"<!--\n              -->\"But then, a lovely one approached me of his own accord, as though inviting me to dance.\"<!--\n              -->\"I accepted his invitation, and together we spun and twirled. The wind lifted the petals, adorning our dance with their colors.\"<!--\n              -->\"Mother, I think... I've made a new friend.\"<!--\n              -->Strangely, soon after its appearance, the Knights of Favonius traced the poem back to its source after being tipped off by some unknown party. They erased its title and sealed away the collection it appeared in, marking it as a forbidden text.<!--\n              -->At the time, people had no idea why the Knights of Favonius acted as they did. But if you take a keen interest in Durin's story and dig a little deeper, you might find an alchemist's experimental notes revealing that Durin's consciousness came from beyond the heavens and was fused with the body of the wicked dragon through alchemy. Corrupted by Abyssal power, his senses and experiences were far removed from those of ordinary beings. Until his fall, he never had any choice but to become the embodiment of disaster, and he likely could not make sense of the cruel world around him.<!--\n              -->Seen this way, the poem might actually be telling Durin's story from his own perspective.<!--\n              -->A certain mage chanced upon this tale and could not help but feel a pang of regret. If the soul known as Durin could have freed itself from the Abyss's curse and ultimately forged a friendship with Dvalin, how different might the ending have been?<!--\n              -->Perhaps to reconcile this lingering sorrow, the mage set pen to paper and wove a new story into being, one in which the protagonist bore the name Durin."

    "text": "When Durin first arrived in Mondstadt, he always preferred to avoid crowded places. He was like a lone splash of color at the edge of a painting — striking, yet unable to form any meaningful scene. Trapped in this static blot, he struggled to make new friends and begin the story that was truly his own.<!--\n              -->At that time, Lisa had just accepted Jean's request to become Durin's tutor. She observed all this and quickly realized that Durin was not naturally solitary. His yearning to make friends was evident, yet he hesitated at every turn. When Lisa asked him about it, he finally confessed his worries.<!--\n              -->\"I... I don't know how to get along with other humans...\"<!--\n              -->\"Well, learning how to interact with people is indeed a prerequisite for friendship,\" Lisa replied, \"but that is not something that can be taught in a classroom.\"<!--\n              -->So Lisa assigned Durin an extracurricular task — to step out of his room and observe how the people of Mondstadt interacted with one another. The request from his mentor dissolved most of his hesitation, and he finally left his room, just as he had once climbed out of his hiding place in the mine.<!--\n              -->Durin's first choice for guidance was Albedo, whom he regarded as a genius who seemed to know everything. But when it came to learning \"human social skills\"... Albedo glanced around his alchemy workshop, secluded amidst the surrounding snowfields, and after a moment's thought suggested that Durin find a more suitable teacher.<!--\n              -->Next, Durin thought of Klee. She seemed capable of befriending anyone. Surely she knew of an effective method for connecting with others. Klee's advice, however, was simply to \"go fish blasting with them.\" In her view, two people who had blasted fish side by side could certainly count as comrades-in-arms. Durin only began to understand what she meant after being locked in the confinement room with her by Jean.<!--\n              -->Durin also considered seeking help from Dahlia and Kaeya. After all, one was a deacon with an adept listening ear, and the other the Cavalry Captain eager to help others. Once Durin explained his situation, the two immediately agreed and took him to the Angel's Share. There, the reticent Durin watched as the tavern's patrons raised their glasses, singing and laughing together. In Mondstadt, this was clearly \"human social interaction.\" However, after just a single sniff of the bar's beverages, Durin nearly toppled over. Luckily, the composed bartender quickly swapped his drink for juice. This method of socializing, he realized, was beyond him... at least for the moment.<!--\n              -->Still, the experience sparked an idea. He ventured to another tavern, quieter and free from the dizzying fumes of alcohol. There, people socialized through a card game called \"Genius Invokation TCG.\" But before Durin could even find an opponent, he was swarmed by a group of cats, only escaping thanks to Diona's intervention...<!--\n              -->A few days passed in the blink of an eye. Durin tried again and again but never quite learned a practical way to interact with others, and in the end, he hadn't completed the extracurricular assignment Lisa had set for him.<!--\n              -->However, when he went back to report, Lisa did not blame him.<!--\n              -->\"Then let's treat this as a long-term assignment. When you feel ready, come find me and I'll check your results.\"<!--\n              -->\"Really? Thank you, ma'am!\"<!--\n              -->Lisa hadn't eased her requirements carelessly. She could see that Durin was no longer the isolated, colorless block he had been before. He had begun to find his place in the world. Albedo had set up extra heating in his mountain workshop, the knights sometimes left an extra chair in the confinement room, the Angel's Share had a bar seat reserved just for juice, and a special table occasionally appeared outside The Cat's Tail. In truth, human interaction had no fixed form. Everyone brought their own edges, rough or otherwise, collided with one another, and eventually found the places where they fit. Unbeknownst to him, Durin had already become part of this picture. His colors were still a little unusual, but he now added to the many interesting scenes unfolding around him. The people appearing in these scenes were his friends, present and future. The events taking place within them were his story.<!--\n              -->And once he came to realize this, his assignment would be complete."

    "text": "When Durin first arrived in Teyvat, Sumeru was his first stop. At that time, he had not yet gained a human body and was known to everyone as \"Mini Durin.\" His very existence was extraordinary, which naturally drew the attention of the curious and the unscrupulous alike. Fortunately, Hat Guy served not only as his guide but also as his bodyguard. With nothing more than his perpetually gloomy expression, he could scare off most nosy bystanders, while the mercenaries hired by merchants trafficking exotic beasts rarely lasted a single encounter in his presence.<!--\n              -->Those days were light and happy ones for Durin. By strict comparison, Teyvat could not match the peace and comfort of Simulanka, yet he found himself enchanted by this new world.<!--\n              -->But the one doubt that lingered in Durin's mind after arriving in this world came from Hat Guy himself.<!--\n              -->As a dragon born of fairy tales, Durin viewed everyone as a unique story. Living in Sumeru with Hat Guy, he was fortunate enough to witness countless tales, such as \"Rainforest, Mushrooms, Tail Care, and Big Ears,\" or \"The Akademiya, Jokes Dragons Don't Understand, Genius Invokation TCG, and Big Ears on a Hat.\" Occasionally, trips into the desert offered opportunities to read \"Desert, Games of Catch, and the Little Wolfhound\"...<!--\n              -->Yet whenever Durin looked at Hat Guy, the one who had spent the most time by his side, he could see no story at all.<!--\n              -->In the end, Durin didn't voice his doubts to Hat Guy. He felt it was simply too soon, so he stayed close, hoping to uncover Hat Guy's story. Not long after, however, the latter suggested ending their journey.<!--\n              -->\"I've had enough of our little trip for now. You should go bother someone else, or return to that fairy tale world of yours.\"<!--\n              -->\"No, I still don't know your story!\"<!--\n              -->Durin stood firm in his refusal. Though Hat Guy's tone was, as always, sharp enough to make anyone frown, Durin could tell he wasn't just trying to send him away out of impatience. The real reason Hat Guy wanted him to leave seemed to lie hidden somewhere within his own story — one Durin had yet to uncover.<!--\n              -->Had it been anyone else, Hat Guy would probably have just turned and walked away. But he saw the determination in Durin's eyes. Ever since the day Durin decided to follow him on his journey across Teyvat, Hat Guy had never once managed to turn him down for good. This time, he relented as well.<!--\n              -->\"Do you wish for your story to take root in this world, Durin?\"<!--\n              -->\"My story... in this world?\"<!--\n              -->\"This will almost certainly be an important choice for you. But if you stay by my side forever, how much of the world will you really come to know? I want you to go farther — to see its beauty, and its ugliness too. Then, once you've seen enough, make your choice.\"<!--\n              -->\"Mmm... but what about your story, Hat Guy?\"<!--\n              -->\"If you decide to plant your story here in this world, I suppose I'll have a small part in it. Just remember that part I played, and that'll be enough. That's my story, as far as you're concerned.\"<!--\n              -->Hearing this, Durin fell silent for a long while. It was the first time he'd ever heard Hat Guy speak to anyone like that — in an encouraging tone, yet tinged with a faint trace of something that almost sounded like a plea.<!--\n              -->In the end, Durin accepted his advice."

    "text": "Before Durin was rescued from the curse via the blessings everyone bestowed upon him, most of his days in Simulanka were spent in the mines, tormented by solitude and despair. Yet when he had first arrived, there had been a brief stretch of happiness. In those days, his mother, Anya \"Marie\" Andersdotter, had still been amongst the living.<!--\n              -->At that time, Simulanka was still under construction. Durin often accompanied his mother whenever she could take a break from her work, exploring the four corners of Simulanka with her.<!--\n              -->Along the way, he watched as she and his two aunts debated how to shape the world around them. Their discussions always started with the same question: What would a world with dragons look like? From that spark came grand designs — valleys carved, tracks laid, castles rising — all brought to life in the midst of their lively debates.<!--\n              -->Sometimes, though, those debates turned into arguments. His fiery-red aunt loved adding thrilling elements — bombs, or anything that would make the world more exciting — while his mother always expressed her worries. She cherished the people of Simulanka as if they were her own children and couldn't stand the thought of their home being reduced to ruins by some reckless artifice. Still, the arguments never lasted long. Soon enough, the fiery-red aunt would find clever ways to adjust her ideas — not only putting his mother's worries to rest, but making their world all the more vibrant and fascinating.<!--\n              -->Back then, the story of Simulanka had yet to be completed, and his mother often paused her writing to think.<!--\n              -->Whenever she did, his pale-blue aunt would come to visit, bringing delicate teacups and plates of delicious sweets. Their conversations were deep and far-reaching, stretching from pleasant afternoons into quiet nights, from the stars above to the future of Simulanka itself.<!--\n              -->During these talks, this pale-blue aunt would often glance at the new scales growing on Durin with a complicated look in her eyes — one that made him uneasy. Still, she always brought wonderful treats, so he didn't mind her visits too much.<!--\n              -->At all other times, his mother could usually be found bent over her desk, writing. Durin would sit quietly by her side, listening to the sound of her pen as he drifted to sleep. He thought those days would go on forever, until one day, his mother suddenly set down her pen, as though she had finally finished her work.<!--\n              -->\"Come, my child,\" she said, rising from her chair. \"Take a walk with me.\"<!--\n              -->She led Durin to a courtyard high up in the sky. Gazing out toward the horizon, she reached out her hand, as if tracing the edge of a page.<!--\n              -->\"My dear, if you ever had the chance... would you want to leave this world and see what lies beyond?\"<!--\n              -->\"Could I really... leave this world?\"<!--\n              -->\"You could,\" she replied with a gentle smile. \"Your aunt Alice is quite remarkable — she's already proven to me that her magic can make it possible.\"<!--\n              -->\"Then... what would happen to me after I leave?\"<!--\n              -->\"That, I can't say,\" she said softly. \"Those are things that shall happen after 'my ending.' But you know, 'going to a faraway land' is a curious phrase — some stories use it as their ending, while others take it as the beginning. Durin, I want you to do something for me. When you have the chance, try leaving Simulanka. Go see what lies out there.\"<!--\n              -->\"There will be many, many hardships waiting for you, but don't be afraid. Alice's magic will guide you... and my blessing will go with you.\"<!--\n              -->Realizing how important her words were, Durin nodded solemnly, accepting the task she had entrusted to him.<!--\n              -->\"In that case,\" she murmured, \"I suppose I've now finished writing the most important passage of all...\"<!--\n              -->Then Durin watched as his mother turned her gaze toward the distant sunset. The emotions that flickered in her eyes were like the light reflected there — burning first with warmth and reluctant farewell, then softening into quiet tenderness, until at last they faded gently into the approaching night.<!--\n              -->Not long after, the gears of Simulanka's destiny began to turn. The origami animals of the Forest of Blessings and the toy figures of Constellation Metropole each set out on the stories woven for them by the three goddesses.<!--\n              -->Yet Durin's mother was gone. His days of happiness had come to an end for now."

    "text": "Carried by the wind that Venti had gifted him, Durin caught up with Dvalin, soaring together into the skies above Windrise. And finally, the story the mage had been writing arrived at the chapter she had been waiting for.<!--\n              -->Standing by the long table where mages gathered for meetings, Alice watched Durin's figure recede into the distance. Her thoughts drifted back through the years to a tea party where all seven of them had been present. Delighted by the occasion, she had been struck by a whim to start a story-telling game, only to stumble when choosing a theme. She turned to Anya, the writer among them, who offered a simple, potent answer: \"The Undying Fire.\"<!--\n              -->\"If I ever get the chance, I want to leave behind an 'Undying Fire' through my stories. As an author, that is the greatest pursuit I can imagine.\"<!--\n              -->\"An 'Undying Fire'? What exactly does that mean?\"<!--\n              -->\"I suspect each of us has our own answer to that question. Isn't that what makes it perfect for a storytelling relay? I am still searching for my own answer, in any case.\"<!--\n              -->Anya didn't answer directly. As she often did in her own works, she left a hint of suspense, sparking Alice's curiosity.<!--\n              -->\"All right, then, let's go with this theme! Each time we meet, the next person will take their turn and write their chapter. Hmm... Anya, you take the final chapter. By the time the story reaches its conclusion, I expect you'll have your answer ready for me.\"<!--\n              -->And so began the relay. Alice volunteered to write the opening — the little witch set off on a journey to find the \"Undying Fire\" in order to complete the trials set by the old witch.<!--\n              -->What Alice didn't anticipate was that by the time the witches gathered again, Anya had passed away, lying in her coffin, asleep forever. She had misjudged how differently witches and humans experienced the passage of time, and how profoundly that would affect Anya. She had been expecting to wait for the next chapter, but Anya had already grown old. By the time the story reached the fifth volume, Anya was gone.<!--\n              -->The tale Alice had begun started veering wildly in the second and third volumes, handled as they were by Barbeloth and Rhinedottir respectively, but it was partially rescued in the fourth volume under Ivanovna. Yet in the fifth volume, penned by Nicole, it was hastily concluded in a single line. Alice felt frustrated, convinced she would never learn the answer Anya had intended.<!--\n              -->The story took a turn with Octavia. The Hexenzirkel had never been marred by a loss since its founding until Anya's passing, a loss that now brought the frequently-absent Octavia to the gathering. She brought with her the already written sixth volume, in which the little witch was given a second chance, reuniting with the old witch.<!--\n              -->\"The Undying Fire might exist after all,\" she said.<!--\n              -->In response to Octavia's reminder, Alice turned her attention to the final work Anya had left behind — the world they had created together, Simulanka. In this world, a dragon named Durin waited, restless and uncertain, for miracles that might come in the future. The possibilities Anya had woven into him, much like the unresolved threads she left in her other works, glowed like a softly burning flame, illuminating the world of the story and tugging at Alice's curiosity. Gazing at this flame, Alice recalled the promise she had once made to Anya.<!--\n              -->\"It seems the ending she was meant to write falls to my pen instead.\"<!--\n              -->And so the years passed, with Alice often turning her gaze to the dragon. She watched the child, once burdened with the name of a drake most fell, receive blessings from others, step out of the world of the story, make friends, forge connections with the world beyond the tale, and together with his companions face and overcome fate. In the end, she saw him completely rewrite the story of Durin the wicked dragon and take flight alongside Dvalin...<!--\n              -->Drawing her thoughts back, Alice realized she had finally received Anya's answer.<!--\n              -->\"Anya, just as I wrote at the end of the storytelling relay, I've always thought you were the most capable among us.\"<!--\n              -->\"You always say you would leave little behind, but I see it now — the undying fire you left for us.\""

Clearly, his mother had cherished him deeply, dressing him as though he were a prince from a fairy tale.<!--\n              -->Still, there was one detail Durin didn't recognize: the heart-shaped gem at the collar.

By using alchemy to fuse Durin with the heart of the evil dragon, he could seal its Abyssal power completely.<!--\n              -->However, the plan was far from perfect. As an essential part of it, Durin would have to bear certain costs. Albedo explained that once the alchemical process was complete, Durin would take the place of the evil dragon and remain in this world. Yet this world was far from the peaceful beauty of Simulanka, and the power he would have to seal was far more terrifying than the curse that had once turned everything into building blocks.<!--\n              -->Albedo knew this could not be a demand made unilaterally — he respected Durin's choice.<!--\n              -->Durin looked toward the distant dragon bones, sensing the guiding force that had led him here.

Along the way, he had faced countless unexpected events, some joyous, some disappointing, none neatly arranged as in a story. Surprises came unbidden, and expectations sometimes fell short.<!--\n              -->Yet it was precisely this uncertainty that captivated Durin, the one who had stepped out from the pages of a tale.

I want to fulfill my mother's request, to leave my story as Hat Guy said, and to help you save everyone... to suppress the evil dragon and become... a true human.\"<!--\n              -->In the end, it was Durin who solemnly entrusted his desire to Albedo.<!--\n              -->\"Please... help me make this wish come true.\"<!--\n              -->And so, a great trial began. The light of the alchemical array blazed across Mondstadt's sky.<!--\n              -->When the dust settled, Durin found a shining Vision at the center of his side of the array.<!--\n              -->His wish had been granted."

Yet, judging by that ever-present grin, you can hardly tell if he is actually there working.Funnily enough, all his \"unorthodox behaviors as a public servant\" are somewhat acquiesced to.His colleagues are more than willing to work with him and his boss seldom criticizes him for being this unfettered.Even his boss's boss inquires after him every now and then.All this can be safely chalked up to his unrivaled prowess as a detective.Whenever the Tenryou Commission is tackling an unusually complicated case, be it a major one or a mysterious one, everyone regards Heizou as their last hope to crack the code.Even the head of the Police Station marvels at his extensive experience in solving cases, but Heizou himself has a different opinion about that.\"Experience is another name for people's past mistakes, and that's not my trump card.\"\"My trump card is something I was born with.\""

Not only do you have to pass the ability test, but also a thorough background check.Therefore, candidates are usually required to declare some essential information, such as any valuable property.According to Yoriki Owada, who was in charge of the check at the time, when Heizou applied, he handed in nothing but a blank declaration form.It was a bright and sunny morning. Sitting opposite Owada, Heizou was curiously exploring the place with his eyes. Owada, who had been around the block by then, spent a moment deciphering the blank form, then looked up and insinuated,\"I've met many brilliant young people. However, it's a shame that none of them made it to the Station in the end.\"Hearing this, all of a sudden, that seemingly hyperactive young man stopped looking around, sat up straight, and looked Owada in the eye.\"Right. How about a young person like me?\"His switching happened so fast that Yoriki Owada was suddenly stunned, feeling like prey in the sights of some hawk-eyed predator.Out of nowhere, a strange sensation came over him, as if at that moment, he was the one being scrutinized.He said jokingly then, as though it would steady his nerves,\"The Tenryou Commission does not discriminate against the poor. But if you have literally nothing to declare, then we'll make sure we pay extra attention to your background.\"It was followed by an unexpected silence. The one sitting opposite looked straight at him without saying a word, just as before.Owada wasn't feeling his best, his forehead slightly twitching. Maybe it was too hot. He made to wipe off the sweat with the back of his hand.However, there was no sweat on his forehead at all. Owada stared blankly at the dry back of his hand, not knowing if he should wipe again or put his hand down.The young man burst out into laughter upon seeing this. His hearty laughter immediately relieved Owada from his overwhelmed state.Heizou just leaned on the table with his chin in one hand, pointing to his head with the other. He smiled at Owada and said,\"Other than my genius, I have nothing to declare.\""

Most detectives also hold this belief dear to their hearts.But Heizou reckons there's more to it. That there might be something that's even more vital than the truth.Years of experience working as a detective have made him aware that when a new case comes to him, that means something unfortunate has already happened.No matter how the criminals are punished for their evil conduct afterward, it cannot change the fact that someone has already been hurt.Similarly, no matter how skilled a doctor is, they will never be able to treat a patient and pretend that nothing ever happened, telling them,\"Look, all your wounds have healed, as if you were never wounded in the first place.\"The truth is from then on, whenever the patient sees a doctor, sees an infirmary, or sees the scars left by the operation, they will be reminded every time of all the wounds that were once on their body, hurting them.Doctors are helpless to prevent violent actions from being executed somewhere. Detectives cannot stop new cases from emerging. But Heizou hopes to break this status quo once and for all.\"If I can't nip evil in the bud, then I shall be its natural enemy.\"\"The name of Shikanoin Heizou will be renowned throughout the world and intimidate anyone with malicious intent all across Teyvat.\"\"They will realize one thing. Once they submit to the darkness, I will hunt them down to the ends of the earth.\"It was at that point that he made his decision to leave the agency and join the Tenryou Commission.It was the starting point for him to become the \"detective\" he seeks to be."

May... maybe your intuition is wrong.\"The sentence Uesugi just uttered seemed to have some magic to it as if it were a closing joke made at the end of a comedy. On hearing that, his nearby senior colleagues all laughed like a supportive audience.The clever Uesugi immediately realized that he had said something inappropriate, so he tried to patch his statement up.\"What I meant is... we can't just rely solely on intuition in our line of work!\"Unexpectedly, everyone laughed even harder this time. Uesugi, not comprehending what had happened, thought to himself that maybe he should really consider being a comedian.At that moment, Heizou brushed his shoulder as if to remove the awkwardness along with the dust.\"I was just joking. Actually, my intuition tells me that you, Uesugi, are going to be an excellent Doushin.\"\"And so, I suggest that you find your own assistant should you have the time.\"No sooner had Heizou finished his sentence than he had run away like the wind, leaving a still-baffled Uesugi and his guffawing colleagues behind....\"You've still got a long way to go before you can be Doushin Shikanoin's assistant.\"\"I was just trying to help since I noticed that he has no assistant...\"\"Of course he does.

The only rule was that the one to knock their opponent from a fifty-pace ring would triumph.To everyone's shock, however, the \"brainy\" Heizou would show up to this contest without using Vision, and he carried no weapon but his two bare fists, which in turn carried him to the final.During that match, Kujou Sara, who had arrived upon hearing rumors of his prowess, assessed that the match was over even before it began.\"Doushin Shikanoin moves lightly and his fists are the match of any weapon. It would be hard to match him in melee — and only a skilled bowman would triumph.\"As she predicted, Heizou's opponent would concede defeat after taking seventeen punches to the left side, with only a streak of Heizou's hair sliced off to show for it.But just as he was about to be crowned champion, Kujou Sara herself walked into the ring and picked up a training bow, requesting a match with Heizou.There was a brief uproar. Most of the people participating in the tournament were rather junior Doushin, and no one had expected that General Kujou herself would attend.Heizou narrowed his eyes. He had originally only come to test his skills, such that he might not be found wanting in the extreme situations where his wits alone would not be sufficient.But at this moment, his blood was up and the spirit of competition had descended on him like it often does on youths, and so he gladly accepted. In a flash, the atmosphere heated up and everyone was flushed with excitement.\"Great going, Heizou!\" Doushin Uesugi yelled from the stands, Yoriki Owada quietly pumping a fist from beside him.After a moment's preparation, both parties entered the ring. The rules were slightly different this time: neither of them would use their Visions. This would only be a contest at fifty paces between Sara's arrow and Heizou's fists. Whoever touched the other first with their weapon would be declared the victor.The atmosphere by now was practically bursting at the seams. The battle was about to begin. Yet few realized that in a battle between experts, each move was peril itself, and that the match would be ended in a single shot.Sara let fly, and fifty paces away, Heizou was seen with his right hand clenched in front of his chest, tightly gripping an arrow that quivered but two finger-widths from his heart like a striking serpent.\"It's my loss. What a frighteningly fast shot,\" Heizou said with a laugh, before throwing the arrow aside. \"There was no time to evade, General, so I was forced to touch your weapon.\"\"I won by dint of the rules alone. I have met very few who could catch one of my arrows barehanded. I doubt the result would be so certain, were this a real battle.\"Sara's eyes glimmered as she spoke such praise.\"Doushin Shikanoin, you are skilled in both mind and hand. You will do great things, should you be more disciplined.\"...Half a month later, a champion's medal specially made by the Tenryou Commission arrived at the Grand Narukami Shrine, along with a handwritten note.\"Here's a little something, cuz, for you to give to my old man when you've got the time. Y'know, just to let him know that I haven't completely made a mess of his teachings and all.\""

    "text": "Heizou mentions his childhood very little, for it was not a happy one.He was born in a remote village where his ancestry was rather prominent and his father was a martial artist of some small repute.But just like every other rebellious child in the world, he only wished to escape having to take up his father's work, even as he was forced to learn martial arts alongside him.This state of affairs would persist until Heizou made a friend who claimed to be from a wealthy merchant family at a festival.This friend was a bright and agile mind, and would often bring all manner of new gadgets for Heizou to play with, saying that they were from his family's storehouse.Books from Sumeru, mysterious toys from Fontaine of all sorts... These toys injected significant vibrance into Heizou's otherwise monotonous life.The friends grew closer as they grew older, but Heizou also began to notice a problem.His friend's clothes were always filthy, hardly the sort of image a rich merchant's son should have.He thus decided to have an honest talk with his friend. They would have a conversation like proper adults.Unexpectedly, his friend immediately admitted to having deceived him, and even confessed that all the gifts he had given Heizou were stolen from the local merchant's guild.He even went so far as to relate that he had originally met Heizou at the festival with the intention to steal some valuables from the latter, only for them to have become friends instead.He laughed as he confessed these matters, as if this was some interesting tale.Heizou was furious, though he knew not what he was angry at: was he angry at having been deceived by his best friend? Or was it because his best friend was a criminal?Regardless, he reprimanded his friend harshly: \"We're not friends anymore!\"Fuming, he returned home, sought out each and every item he had been given, and threw them all out, till nothing but a single green pebble remained.This was one of a pair of \"treasures\" the two of them had fished out from a small stream, and each of them had taken one. This item alone was not tainted by theft, and was perhaps purer even than their friendship.Gazing upon it, Heizou hardened his heart and threw it out the window... only for it to strike the window lattice and come flying back, rolling under his bed.Now irate, and seeing how even the heavens were conspiring against him in this endeavor, Heizou, in a fit of growing pique, dumped himself on the ground like a frog with a punctured belly, refusing to move.Looking at the ceiling despondently, he told himself that he would one day put these ill things out of his mind. Yet the world is such that the more we wish to forget things, the more they shall refuse to be forgotten.A year later, when the festival where he and his friend first met rolled back around, Heizou happened to rediscover the pebble, and had it on him as he traveled to attend the festival.He knew not what he was expecting, but fate already had an answer on hand... though it was not the one Heizou expected.Heizou would meet his friend again that day, collapsed by the roadside in a pool of his own blood amidst the screams of the crowd.Just a moment earlier, his friend had gotten into an altercation with a ruffian who had angled to steal his Mora purse, and who then in a panic had plunged a dagger into his heart.Heizou dashed over to check on his old friend, the pebble in his hand falling by the wayside. Catching sight of it, his friend's dull eyes lit up just a little.\"Come here to see me, did you... Heizou?\"Heizou tried to keep pressure over his good friend's chest, but the blood kept seeping through his fingers, and he was again filled with fury, even more so than the year prior.\"Just shut up! Shut up!\" He yelled at his friend.His friend shook his head, and with great effort opened his purse. There was not a single Mora inside — nothing but the green pebble that had belonged to him.Squeezing the last ounce of his strength out, he held the pebble out to Heizou with a smile broader than when they had parted.\"I... I came to see you, too...\"...Heizou did not recall how he had returned home. His mind was blank, filled with nothing but rage and disgust.But in that moment, his intuition told him that he felt rage and disgust at a certain thing, and that he and it had always been foes.This thing had mixed deception into friendship, and it had caused life to be cut short before its time. \"Sin.\" That was its name.But it was not his friend's sin of deception or theft, nor was it the murder that the thief committed. It was something more abstract, something of a higher order.It was the culmination of all the sins in this world, hovering over all like a titanic shadow covering the skies, fixing its cold and unfeeling gaze on all that was good in this world, and seeking ways to snuff it out.One morning, one month later, Heizou sneaked out of doors to travel afar, leaving a farewell note behind. He had found his enemy, and he would now embark on a journey to make war against it.Accompanying him on this journey was a green stone, but it was not the pebble that symbolized friendship, but instead a Vision that stood for his resolve."

The future of Inazuma was here, inscribed upon a gorgeous blueprint.The automaton had but one question to ask Ei: \"There is no turning back from forsaking your form. Do you regret nothing?\"\"Your existence is my answer.\"Then, Ei transferred her consciousness into her blade, and thus was born the Plane of Euthymia."

    "text": "Before Raiden Ei became the Shogun, she was a samurai responsible for seeing that the previous Shogun's orders were carried out.The previous Electro Archon, Raiden Makoto, was no great fighter, and the things Ei had charge over were mostly matters of warfare and slaughter. However, Ei also had moments of repose away from battle, sitting with her friends under the sakura trees and playing karuta.Due to her character, Ei was always the most wooden player. She was never the final victor, nor did she ever have a taste of the prizes that the Kitsune Saiguu reserved for the winners.Thus, she poured the effort that she put into swordsmanship into karuta practice, often pestering Makoto or Mikoshi Chiyo to karuta matches, or spending much time by moonlight reading the poetry inscribed on the cards out loud.At last, the day came that under the sakura trees, Ei would defeat opponent after opponent. Even the mighty tengu would be felled after a hard-fought battle, and thus was she crowned the champion.Ei let out a victorious whoop at her victory, only to be greeted by the sounds of her friends' laughter. Only then did she realize that she had lost her usual composure entirely, before snapping both arms back down and reverting to her usual cool facade. Of course, her friends did not intend to make sport of her. Indeed, they understood her character and the manner in which she had worked ever so hard to come out on top.As for the Kitsune Saiguu, oh, how amused she looked as she presented Ei with some pastries.\"I said it was a reward, yes, but it was simply some hand-made cakes of mine. I didn't think that you would be so concerned about it, Ei. Well then, enjoy the spoils of your victory to your heart's content.\"Ei was hardly one to be greedy for snacks. But as a samurai, she firmly believed that what she lost must be reclaimed. These pastries were more akin to a vindication of her desire to win.—But it was not long before that cool demeanor of hers broke into a smile again. The cakes were lovely — just like the taste of victory. As for her clumsy attempts to hide that smile, one could only say that it was an entertaining sight all around for her friends.To this day, Ei still often remembers that sakura tree....Even though she has not gone to see it in a long time, and even though no one sits under it anymore, she wishes that time might stop forever."

Instead, Makoto's energies were focused on the present.\"It is precisely because we know that this scene is but a fleeting shadow that we should enjoy it all the more.\"Then, Ei could only smile wryly, realizing that she, the kagemusha, was even more old-fashioned than the real Raiden Shogun. She thought to herself that she must learn to be more leisurely, just like Makoto.Yet the times changed all too quickly, all but catching Ei off guard. Before she knew it, her hands already held the blade that the dying Raiden Makoto had passed on to her.This day, the kagemusha was now the true Raiden Shogun.And it was on this day that Ei truly felt the agony of erosion.As time marched forward inexorably, even this blade, this sakura... All life on Inazuma would fade before her eyes.This was the foundation of Inazuma, and it was the thing that the Raiden Shogun must defend.\"If you look at it this way, thinking ahead is not meaningless, nor is it vain arrogance.\"Having resolved herself, her life exceeded its mortal shell, and eternity descended upon the mortal plane."

Thus, you have become my enemy.\"Back when she was creating the puppet, Ei had considered all the hidden risks involved.She believed that anything was possible — including the worst-case scenario... in which she too would someday become a threat to Eternity.But she had to press on. She had to reach Eternity. This, she would not permit to be stayed by any outside force.The puppet's words were something that she had asked herself long ago:\"You believe that you are more firmly convicted now than you were yesterday, and that is why you are presently correct. Is that so?\"\"Do you presently have some new ideas, or have you, too, fallen victim to inexorable 'erosion'?\"Their faces were the same, but they spoke of different ideals. The battle with herself, with her past, would come someday.But it was not this day. Ei knew well that she was not yet ready.Her heart was clear, and she would have remained in that state, but hearing the cries of her people, she had to command her feet to stop.The sky above the mirror was no longer empty, and all about the silent halls, she heard the cry of crows. Dawn was coming. The samurai must take up her sword.This dream was ever so real, and it, too, passed like a shadow."

The sword was stained with blood, then, and as the blade drew its first taste of crimson, the dripping ichor was blown aside by wild winds and blazing thunder.Makoto gave it the name Musou Isshin, and desired to have it witness an Inazuma as lovely as a dream and the noble hearts that dwell in this world.Ei did not change its name. For she, too, had looked out over that vast scene of beauty, and the sight of it had engendered a stronger, purer dream in her own heart.The aesthetic of lightning is precisely to capture that which is precious amidst fleeting transience."

She was not precisely someone to be trusted, but she was in many ways also Ei's best choice.Upon hearing this request, Miko could not help but joke: \"Aren't you afraid that I might just sell this off?\"\"You understand the value of a Gnosis. Even if you sold it, I trust that you would have exchanged it for something of equal value, and that is no easy price to pay.\"With someone of Yae Miko's character, it would be no surprise if she ever sold the Gnosis, yes, but she would not allow herself to lose out in any such exchange.Such, then, was the tacit agreement between the two old friends. Yae Miko understood Ei's intent and took the precious Gnosis with a smile.\"Well, this is your idea, not mine. Don't end up regretting this, now.\""

To set his father free from the unbearable agony, Diluc Ragnvindr took his life.Kaeya was Diluc's brother by adoption and was always by his side, but on this occasion Kaeya did not partake in the final moments shared between father and son.The torrential rain that set in on Mondstadt that night seemed to be a sign of the heavens' grief at the passing of Master Crepus.There was a side to Kaeya that he kept hidden from the world: In truth, he was an agent of Khaenri'ah, placed in Mondstadt to serve their interests. His father had abandoned him in this strange and unknown land to fulfill this mission, and it was Master Crepus and the city of Mondstadt that had welcomed him with open arms when they found him.If Khaenri'ah and Mondstadt went to war, which side should he support? To whom should he offer his assistance: his birth father, who had ruthlessly abandoned him? Or his adoptive father, who had loved him and raised him?For the longest time, Kaeya had agonized over these impossible questions, caught between the opposing demands of loyalty and duty, faced with an impossible choice between truth and happiness.But now, Crepus' death upset this delicate balance. He felt liberated, but also ashamed of how selfishly he was responding. As an adopted son, he should have saved Crepus, but he had arrived moments too late. As a brother, he should have shared in Diluc's grief, and yet as their father lay dying on the ground, he had hung back behind his brother, that ancient plot running through his mind.Consumed by guilt, Kaeya knocked on Diluc's door. As the rain poured down, the shroud of secrecy was washed away and all lies were revealed. Kaeya had finally come clean.He had anticipated Diluc's anger. The brothers drew their blades, this time pointing them at each other. Kaeya felt that this was his punishment for a lifetime of lies.But as the two crossed blades, Kaeya was overcome by the sensation of great elemental power surging through him. For years, he had stayed out of the way in his brother's shadow. But now, for the first time ever, he was facing his brother as his true self.Bitterly cold and brittle elemental energy burst forth from the tip of his sword to meet Diluc's searing flames head-on. The clash of crimson fire and azure ice created a sudden swirl of wind that stunned them both. This was the grim moment at which Kaeya's Vision appeared.Since that day, Kaeya and Diluc have gone their separate ways. But he never discusses it, just as he never discusses the origin of his Vision.Though it is a reminder of a hard-fought battle, and the prize that he earned in exchange for revealing the unadulterated truth, Kaeya sees it as a stern reminder that he must live the rest of his life under the heavy burden of lies."

He is one of the most high-profile figures in the industry.\nAs a designer and an outstanding alumnus, Kaveh has quite the reputation among Akademiya students and is idolized as a role model by the students of Kshahrewar. Unfortunately, his career is not as plain-sailing as people imagine. The same can be said for many other facets of his life.\nTitles, rumors, fame, and reputation... These are all mere by-products of his work. Equipped with astounding professional design skills, Kaveh puts his heart and soul into his work and is imbued with ideals and pursuits for aesthetics and architectonics. Designers are not in charge of the construction's final execution, yet they hold responsibility for all its aspects. Thus, be it design details, safety and security, or practicality, no effort may be spared in ensuring the quality of each aspect. On top of that, being one of the best in his field, Kaveh pays additional attention to the aesthetic and human elements that he is concerned about throughout the process. For him, designs that are completely divorced from reality should be classified as fantasy, whereas a building that is actually put into construction must have practical value.\nThat said, it is rather inconceivable that such an extraordinary architect could have been rendered bankrupt by a single project. Fortunately, very few know about this matter, and most of them keep it a secret. As for Kaveh himself, he is deathly afraid that the secret of his bankruptcy might ever leak out. It is thus fair to say that he is not really living his ideal life."

Kaveh himself, however, is unfortunately unmoved by this title.<!--\n              -->Such lovely names and titles are, to him, acknowledgment and shackles both.

In fact, such undue candor might result in a crisis of reputation for him.

    "text": "Up till today, one can hear Kshahrewar students discuss and speculate about their alumnus Kaveh at the Palace of Alcazarzaray and various parts of the Akademiya. In the hearts of his Darshan-mates, Kaveh is a genius nigh-unparalleled in the last few decades and an architect of great fame. Kaveh has, by his outstanding works, engraved his name into the history of the Akademiya. If you are to meet Kshahrewar students, it wouldn't hurt to listen to them extol his achievements: Single-handedly designing the Palace of Alcazarzaray, renovating the landmark lighthouse of Port Ormos, modifying the port's elevators and cargo-handling structures, his pioneering role in the spatial optimization of the peripheral areas surrounding forests and valleys... The list goes on.<!--\n              -->Clad in these achievements, Kaveh has become more than a simple name, but a synonym for achievement in the field of design. Many wish they could have a resume like his: brilliantly talented in school, invited to work in various major construction agencies after graduation, and leaving after several years to do work under his own name.<!--\n              -->All outsider readings of his life stop here, and almost none know of the hidden truth behind the stories — the truth that Kaveh himself is trying to hide. It is true, of course, that he is an exceptional designer. It is a shame, then, this has not allowed him to live the perfect life that others think he does.<!--\n              -->He would summarize his past experiences in this way: Misunderstandings are troublesome but inevitable. All people are vulnerable to momentary lapses in judgment and to the influence of rigid labels. For example, their first reaction to \"designer\" is the fantasy of someone who earns Mora with a flick of their fingers, who becomes famous with but a few strokes of a pen. And when people think about \"the arts,\" the first thing that emerges is the bizarre, unfounded image of some lackadaisical, self-centered soul who swings between bouts of gloom and mania, and who is all too fond of bossing others about.<!--\n              -->Kaveh does not fit any such imaginative fantasies. He cannot complete his designs in a single stroke, instead approaching every job earnestly. He dresses like a successful person, but in truth, he does not judge the merit of a project by the remuneration alone. He is principled beyond most other people in Sumeru, believing that \"art\" is the wellspring of a life in design, and yet does not forsake humanistic purpose or practicality in the process. Indeed, he is willing to make some compromises for these two things. Sometimes, he compromises on rest time, other times it is the ornamentation and trappings of the project... and sometimes it is his own pay.<!--\n              -->After many years, he finally succeeded. The Palace of Alcazarzaray was completed, and he returned to Sumeru in glory. His colleagues had naught but praise for the fabled palace atop a large tree, stunned as they were by its designer's astounding imagination. They gorged themselves upon the way in which the structure united architectural function and human narrative into its elegant design values, resulting in luxurious craftsmanship that yet exists as a testament to precision and elegance, rewriting the atmosphere of the surrounding mountainous space with its very presence. No one would say that the Palace of Alcazarzaray was any less than an exceedingly successful experiment.<!--\n              -->Those colleagues, however, were blissfully unaware of how Kaveh went bankrupt over this project due to a mix of personal principle, the vagaries of life, and other problems layered atop one another. After all, the truth — much like the troubled gestation of this success — has remained well-hidden thanks to Kaveh's efforts."

    "text": "Kaveh was born into a classic scholarly family in Sumeru. His father was from the Rtawahist Darshan and once worked at the Akademiya, while his mother had graduated from Kshahrewar, and much as he would become later in life, she too was a famous architect. Influenced by them, Kaveh was interested in architectural design from a young age. They would sit in the living room as he sat at home playing with the block puzzles they had bought for him.<!--\n              -->Theirs was a house in which words were not necessary, and Kaveh would gain his understanding of \"home\" from this time.<!--\n              -->However, their blissful days were not to last. Some time before he joined the Akademiya, his father would, at his encouragement, join the Interdarshan Championship. The competition itself was not a complicated affair, but his father, who became a favorite to win, would miss becoming champion by a hair, and then proceeded to go missing for a time afterward.<!--\n              -->Soon, the bad news came: His father had perished in an accident in the desert. The suddenness of this misfortune threw mother and son into disarray. His mother was hit particularly hard. Being a sensitive soul by nature, her husband's passing would cause her to break down, spending much time in anxious, gloomy thought. As for Kaveh, he would see his father's laugh and promise to bring something nice back for him as he walked out that door every time he closed his eyes to sleep. Young Kaveh thought that had he not said anything, his father might not have taken part in the contest, and he would not have gone missing afterward, and finally perished as a result. But no matter how he begged, the past could not be changed.<!--\n              -->His father's death, his mother's agony... all these things that could no longer be taken back were on the account of a single thing he had said. From that day forward, he would live under the shadow of that guilt.\nHis mother would say that her husband was a man with a good heart, and that life at such a person's side made her happy. Indeed, after his passing, she would never again smile. \"Home\" went from a sanctuary of warmth and light to a cold and lonely hall. Kaveh would often find his mother sitting on the sofa staring at her trembling hands in silence. She could neither draw anything at all, nor even conceive of a design in her mind. Each time this happened, Kaveh would feel like a giant hand was crushing him to the ground, and he would question himself: Were it not for me, would the family have ended up like this?<!--\n              -->At that time, he was still young, and he could do very little. Out of guilt, he would do his best to keep his mother company, and he would never wear a disappointed face around her, trying to support her in any way he could, even if such was but a drop in the bucket.<!--\n              -->It was amidst this chaos that Kaveh would reach schooling age and, having passed the entrance exams, enroll into Kshahrewar. During this time, he would inevitably spend less time with his mother. She would thus travel to Fontaine to ease her soul a little. There, she would receive a job offer, and upon returning to Sumeru, she informed Kaveh of the good news. Kaveh knew that this would leave him to live alone, but still, he agreed, and even saw his mother off on the day she departed.<!--\n              -->He would continue to look on even after her ship had long left the harbor. He would deeply miss her, but he knew that it was best that she left the place that had come to represent so much pain for her. For her sake, Kaveh would never admit that he was lonely. He assured her that he was all grown up now and could live independently. And if he should be kept awake at night by loneliness, pain, or memories of their now-broken family, why, it was his just desserts for egging his father on to take part in the competition. One guilty of harming his parents so deeply deserved all that came to them, and so he must live on bearing that brand.<!--\n              -->Given that such thoughts have been his constant companions since, one could say that \"home\" taught Kaveh how to care, and also utterly purged him of the ability to knowingly harm another person. In the many years afterward, he would remain trapped by his personality and ideals, desiring to help any and all who asked it of him, and unable to truly oppose others even if he wished to try and resist on some matters. Despite the good he often does, his guilt remains. More than this, he cannot accept pure goodwill, for when he makes choices, he believes that he should be punished, and finds some comfort in the pain.<!--\n              -->If Kaveh were a sculpture, he would be one that appeared all but flawless, but which would suffer utter destruction if the weak point in its core were to be found."

    "text": "After graduating, Kaveh's first project was helping out with a group project with other students of the same Darshan, though they had different mentors. This being his debut as the person responsible for design, the work weighed heavily on him. But he is (by his own admission) a stubborn person, and he would spend all his energy on his work, and thus would he shoulder the work for others, heedless of the hour, on all manner of projects for two entire years.<!--\n              -->Once he had gained enough experience, Kaveh left these cooperative projects behind to work in his own name, gaining a clientele who appreciated his style. Some would ask him to design buildings, and this marked the beginning of his career. By dint of his hard work, he was able to save up a good sum of Mora. It did not take long, however, for Kaveh to hit a bottleneck. The demands of the market were very different from academic design. It was more pragmatic, more snobbish, and the clients' requirements were far harder to meet than his mentors' had been. At the same time, academic trends in Sumeru were disrupting his work. He began to realize that his ideals and career goals were, as a certain someone had said, not easily attainable.<!--\n              -->New iterations of the schools of thought and viewpoints amongst researchers were constantly being created, and there was no lack of those who would engage in self-critique and self-reflexive questioning, with changes and improvements in social factors encouraging such considerations. As such, things that were once recommended might someday become objects of criticism, whether they be actual books or art.<!--\n              -->But other than those who had given themselves wholly over to art, no one could understand what artists in Sumeru had to endure. As academic accomplishment became ever more prized in Sumeru, researchers would in turn value pure academic accomplishments and practical skills more highly. The Six Sages would grow ever more radical in their ways, and the idea that \"the arts provide no real benefits\" started to become mainstream. Thus, those who worked in the arts would be marginalized, and those subjects that were often related to the arts sought to distance themselves.<!--\n              -->The engineering projects that Kaveh came into contact with were highly streamlined, bereft of flair or style. He would suggest various beautiful designs, only to have them rejected on the grounds that they were \"meaningless presentation,\" or that \"this project only needs practical buildings.\" His original pursuit was to make good designs for all that incorporated both artistic beauty and practicality, but now that the arts had become a joke, and people rejected their necessity and value, no one would give him freedom to work on his designs. Kaveh, believing that architecture was indeed art, resolutely opposed such viewpoints. But his job required him to have technical support and investments, and so he could not escape these circles, nor could he simply put his views out there in the open for fear that he might drag too many others down with him.<!--\n              -->With his dreams and career now at odds, Kaveh gave himself a long vacation. But when he returned home, he received an unexpected letter from Fontaine. It was from his mother, and she wrote that she had found someone to whom she could entrust the rest of her life, and as such was going to remarry in Fontaine. It was this news that she would, with great trepidation and expectation, relate to her only relative.<!--\n              -->Kaveh wrote back and congratulated her, and would even go to Fontaine to take part in the wedding. It was a simple affair, and only a few guests were present. Seeing his mother smile once more, Kaveh felt glad, but felt lost again almost immediately afterwards.<!--\n              -->His mother would leave all her property in Sumeru to him. Three days later, he would return to Sumeru, and once again felt the terror of the empty home — the mere act of sitting on the sofa tormented him with heretofore unmatched solitude. Here, he felt the old adage of all wise scholars being fulfilled: \"Do the right thing, no matter what it costs you.\""

The wealthy merchant, Lord Sangemah Bay, sought him out to construct a private mansion.<!--\n              -->Lord Sangemah Bay had become fairly famous, but Kaveh had no idea that this \"Lord\"'s name was in fact Dori until they met, nor did he have any reckoning of her power and riches. She only had two conditions for this mansion, that it be large and extravagant. Kaveh would probe her concerning design style and other details, but she was unconcerned with such. Even amongst his clients, Dori stood out as a bit of an oddity. She did business, but seemed to care little for what researchers thought. She wanted her mansion built in a secluded place — for business needs, or so she claimed — and Kaveh was told not to ask too many questions and simply aim to make a truly awe-inspiring estate. As for aesthetics, Dori neither cared for nor stopped him from doing anything he wished.<!--\n              -->Kaveh realized almost immediately how rare it was to come by such a commission. A mansion construction project without limitations meant that he could put his all into it. Party A would fork out the resources, while Party B would do the work — was this not how their business should be? And was allowing academic views to restrict development and growth not utterly wrong-headed? So it was with that Kaveh threw himself in planning these designs with a sudden fervor, and, in his role as \"Party B,\" he advised Dori to make some adjustments. A true mogul could not simply live in the mountains. If this estate was to go down in history, it had to be something of truly legendary beauty! A garden was a must, with the flowers carefully selected, of course, with the input of professional botanists. The conceptualization must be bold, the planning conscientious. The buildings themselves would prioritize practicality, but the requested warehouses and facilities would rest upon a luxuriant foundation. And as for location... the cliff-side in the northern mountains looked good. Lord Sangemah Bay would awaken every day with a window onto the loveliest natural views that could be had.<!--\n              -->Though Dori would constantly insist that the mansion did not have to be close to a cliff, Kaveh's engineering spirit and aesthetic appetites drove him on to convince her otherwise. Thus did the project begin with a flourish, and as the days passed, work proceeded apace under Kaveh's watchful eye.<!--\n              -->Yet his ideals would not be so easily achieved, for though Kaveh's diligence in selecting a site had been immaculate, and he had made every consideration, he could not have anticipated the speed at which the Withering would expand its reach that year. When the work was 70% complete, on a quiet night, the Withering crept in silently, destroying all that had been built overnight. The sight of his creation's devastated corpse struck Kaveh like a furious thunderbolt. Dori, who had rushed down upon receiving the news, was in incomparable fury, demanding that Kaveh leave the project. Though the Forest Rangers quickly dispersed The Withering, the buildings were beyond saving.<!--\n              -->Yet he knew that it would be difficult to ever get a chance of this sort again, and so he begged Dori to let him finish the Palace of Alcazarzaray. Dori would point out the crucial problem with stark sharpness: He had been the one to insist on the change of site. Now that the palace had been destroyed, taking the investment put in thus far with it, how could the project continue, even assuming that she did not pursue the matter with him? If they were to rebuild the structure, who would bear the cost for the losses?<!--\n              -->Kaveh sat atop the ruins as he contemplated this all night long. He had his savings, and the property his parents had left behind. That had once been his \"home,\" but now, it was just an empty building. And what was a \"home,\" anyway? An architect like him knew better than most that a construction bereft of a family or people to dwell in it was no \"home.\" It was simply a building.<!--\n              -->When the sun rose, Kaveh returned to Sumeru City and sold that house. Adding all the proceeds from that sale, along with his savings, to the funds Dori had provided with him, he was able to come up with 70% of the necessary Mora required, with Dori coming up with the rest.<!--\n              -->Thus was the Palace of Alcazarzaray built on a beautiful, sunny day. Kaveh had given all he possessed to build a legendary palace that did not belong to him in the slightest. He did not earn a single Mora on this project. On the contrary, some slight overspending on the follow-up work would leave him heavily in debt to Dori. While Kaveh made a token show of resisting, he knew in his heart that he could not deny the fact that he did indeed owe this debt. His heart was once again consumed by that old guilt, and Lord Sangemah Bay, shrewd merchant that she was, could immediately perceive that he was paying not for her sake, but for that of his ideals.<!--\n              -->And if someone wanted to martyr their entire fortune on the altar of their ideals, who was she to stop them? Construction was ultimately just business, but ideals were priceless. As for how Kaveh would come to be homeless afterward, that is a different story."

    "text": "After going bankrupt, Kaveh entered into a period of melancholy. The Palace of Alcazarzaray had ever so briefly filled the hole in his heart that had been ripped open by so many things, but it had also proved to him once again that no matter what he gave to attain his ideals, it wasn't enough. He was now directionless, and enmeshed in a world where he could not go anywhere without Mora. And yet he was accustomed since his youth to putting on a brave front, and so Kaveh was unwilling to let his colleagues and friends know that he was nigh penniless even after selling all he owned, and so he went to a tavern, where he would order a few bottles and chat to comfort himself. One bottle later, he would collapse at the table, only to wake up in the exact same position afterward.<!--\n              -->Lambad, the tavern owner, had reserved a seat and a few free drinks for him out of kindness, and as thanks, Kaveh helped him redesign and refit the booth seating area of the tavern's second floor. He would occasionally meet friends from his Akademiya schooling days, and with them he would pretend that he was just here to drink and gather inspiration. He would spend over a fortnight in this manner, during which he would encounter that friend that he no longer called \"friend.\"<!--\n              -->When discussing Kaveh's old friends, the current Akademiya Scribe, Alhaitham of Haravatat, will invariably get mentioned. Alhaitham enrolled at a later date than most of those his age, but his grades stood out above the rest. People didn't know who he was or where to find him normally, only that he was some student who had gotten high marks. And when his name was mentioned, even the old researchers from Kshahrewar would shake their heads and say that he was too intelligent by half and hard to get along with.<!--\n              -->At that time, Kaveh had just parted ways with his mother and was living alone. He would meet this junior student in the library at times, and would speak to him out of curiosity, and thus did he meet the Haravatat genius Alhaitham. But time would go on to prove that wishful thinking alone does not friends make. For Kaveh quickly realized that Alhaitham, though two years his junior and admittedly both extremely talented and incredibly gifted, was also utterly different from him, whether it be in personality, dealing with people, academic direction, and convictions.<!--\n              -->Kaveh's time in school would leave him with a great many memories, the least pleasant of which is the group project they undertook together. Each recognized the other's ability, and they decided to conduct research regarding ancient structures, ancient runes, and linguistics, with Kaveh suggesting that Alhaitham be the one responsible for selecting the topic. At first, others would take also take part in the cooperative project, but as the work progressed, the other students dropped out gradually as they could not keep up.<!--\n              -->That was the first time Kaveh realized the brutal and all-too-intuitive difference in talent between individuals. The Akademiya linked talent and resources to an extreme degree, and all here knew that. As Alhaitham liked to put it, certain matters have their upper limit determined by talent and their lower bound determined by hard work. Ordinary people and geniuses would be separated by various practical realities, and they did not have to force themselves to fit into a group they did not belong to. Kaveh, however, was resolute in his belief that this was all the result of obstacles that appeared during the process, and that wisdom should be uncovered by many people. To prevent the other students from backing out, Kaveh spent much time and effort helping them with their work, placing a great burden on his own shoulders. Alhaitham persisted in upholding the opposite view, believing Kaveh to be too idealistic in his ways — academia was not charity work, and temporary salvation would not change the reality of their differences in ability. Thus did discord arise between the two.<!--\n              -->Finally, the day came when only two people remained working on the topic: Alhaitham and Kaveh. The disputes between them accumulated to a critical mass before exploding spectacularly. Kaveh maintained that Alhaitham was too much of an egoist, that he could be much better welcomed amongst people if he would just care about helping out more often. Alhaitham for his part pointed out that Kaveh's impractical idealism was just a flight from reality, and that it would come to be a burden on his existence someday, and the source of Kaveh's altruism was naught but his inescapable sense of guilt. At that moment, more than anything else, Kaveh felt cut to the quick by someone who was his best friend. Alhaitham had seen through the reality that he had never been able to face, causing him to feel reality's bite for the first time, a feeling that made Kaveh steadfastly declare that he regretted making friends with this all-too-intelligent person.\nThe two parted ways in a single stroke. Alhaitham would remove his name from that thesis, while Kaveh would rip his copy of the thesis apart in a fury — only to put it back together with deep regret. He sensed that he would not be able to change his friend, with the reverse also being true.<!--\n              -->Afterwards, the two would later clash in academic journals several times, each criticizing the other's perspective. Before this, the \"Decoding the Runes and Architectural Philosophy of the Ruins of King Deshret's Civilization\" had made great progress. Its fruits on the linguistics front had filled various gaps in the grammatical logic of some ancient minor languages, allowing for the successful interpretation of many important texts. Similarly, the results achieved in architectural studies had successfully improved the load-bearing structures for some special terrain features in Sumeru, which greatly improved the lives of those living in remote regions. To encourage the project, the Akademiya had even specially designated a research site for its use. Unfortunately, lacking manpower and a united vision on the part of its primary researchers, it eventually ground to a halt.<!--\n              -->This failed project became an unavoidable part of Kaveh's past. As the years passed, and he was beaten back by reality time and time again, Kaveh was forced to admit that his persistence born of wishful thinking was not always useful. It was only when he was rendered penniless that he finally understood the deeper meaning behind his friend's past words. A person who wished to ascend to the garden of heaven upon steps made of thin air would inevitably plant their feet on an empty stair and fall to their death. As a genius, Kaveh longed to belong in a crowd, subconsciously fearing separation from it — this was the difference between him and Alhaitham.<!--\n              -->Returning to the matter of that table in the tavern, Kaveh was deeply shocked to see Alhaitham, who was coincidentally present to purchase some alcohol, in this place. Alhaitham for his part could immediately tell that Kaveh was in a very bad way. Having been oppressed by life for too long, Kaveh completely unloaded all his woes onto his erstwhile friend right there and then. After all, there was nowhere to hide from his problems, so what use was concealing them in front of the one friend with whom he had fallen out so acrimoniously? He would lament about a great many misfortunes that had befallen him, only falling silent when they left the tavern in the dead of night, and his eyes fell upon a place in the distance that he once called home. Alhaitham, on the other hand, listened intently to Kaveh's words, and seeing through him once more, asked him a difficult question: \"How has realizing your ideals gone for you?\"<!--\n              -->Only reality can force a researcher to admit that they were wrong, but Kaveh did not know what he should consider reality. He yearned for a fantasy so perfect and beautiful that none need flee it, even if the price of this dream was losing himself. He still firmly believed that his ideals were in themselves not mistaken, and that the fault lay only in the methods used to achieve them.<!--\n              -->People should not give up, for even if they are doing good in an attempt to make up for something, the results will still have meaning for some. Even if he could not enter that promised land of his ideals, that did not mean the radiance and the attraction of such a realm should be denied.<!--\n              -->As for those phantasm-like realities, like how he found his homeless self living his friend's house by happenstance, or how this house, now under the Scribe's name, had been converted from that same research center the Akademiya had offered them back in the day, or how this excess academic asset would not have been turned into a residence at all after numerous transactions, had Kaveh not resolved to give it up... Or how, knowing full well that Alhaitham never did perform a good deed unconditionally, Kaveh would be plagued by guilty conscience and proactively mention helping with household chores, only to become saddled with all the domestic errands... These might be an annoyance for someone at a low point in life, but they are also proof the most unshakable part of one's past is a friend that will never change. Rationality and sensibility, language and architecture, knowledge and human feelings... Things that can never be integrated are what constitute the two sides of the mirror — indeed, of the entire world."

Though all of us might claim to have a place in this great hall of learning, we must understand that it is people, and not knowledge, that make our world what it is. Without a vessel, knowledge shall have no home.

    "text": "While he was still a student, Kaveh would often be busy with various projects. During this time, he would visit numerous ruins with fellow students. They were all very young at the time, and were as yet unable to descend to the heart of the tombs, but they managed to achieve significant results nonetheless.<!--\n              -->However, the study of ancient ruins comes with its risks, and they would find themselves imperiled despite their professionalism. During one such search, the student team encountered some danger, and there was a cave-in. If not for Kaveh pushing two fellow Kshahrewar students out of the tomb, they would surely have died there. As for Kaveh himself, though he also escaped with some light injuries, he could not stop his fellow students' change of heart. He believed that he was helping them achieve results, but instead most of his fellow students saw only a perceived difference in ability, and troubled by the situation, they elected to quit the project.<!--\n              -->Kaveh knew of the objects known as \"Visions.\" He had originally thought that they would appear at moments of crisis, but he had been through one such mortal crisis already, he had not received the favor of the gods, but instead had to use all his strength to drag everyone out of the fire.<!--\n              -->Years later, Kaveh graduated, left the Akademiya, and threw himself into his work. He had by then ceased to think about Visions for some time, or even consider further as to what kind of people would come into possession of such an item. People said that only those with a wish could receive divine favor this way — perhaps he was just not such a person.<!--\n              -->Everything that happened after flowed like a stream of water, dull and unchanging.

He could do nothing about these things, and they also felt unremarkable and unworthy of mention.<!--\n              -->This persisted till the day the first version of the Palace of Alcazarzaray was destroyed by The Withering, and he was sitting upon the wreck of that building, contemplating the whole night through.

Were it not for the timely guidance of a kind soul, their journey of exploration might have come to an untimely end, cruelly cut short. Many of those who were lost and returned to their companions on the road all had the same name upon their lips: Sethos.\nA great sense of direction, enthusiastic and talkative... These are all common impressions among those who have been on the receiving end of Sethos's guidance. And it is quite true. As a desert-dweller, Sethos knows the paths between the various oases like the back of his hand, and his mastery of the techniques of navigation — such as using the sun's position to calculate direction — runs even deeper. As a personal interest, Sethos enjoys traveling by foot between desert and rainforest, and the navigational skills he's acquired are a product of his personal experiences doing so. As for being enthusiastic and talkative, by speaking with Eremites chance met on the road or listening to the fascinating anecdotes of hapless scholars rescued from swamp and marsh, not only can he broaden his knowledge and horizons, but also have a lot of fun. For Sethos, that is where the joy of the journey lies.\nPerhaps it is because of this personality of his, but regardless of locale, from desert to rainforest, he always has those he can regard as friends. One researcher he met at Caravan Ribat, who had developed a deep admiration for Sethos after being struck by his distinctive understanding of the Akademiya and its knowledge system, once even went so far as to suggest that Sethos sit the Akademiya's entrance exam.\n\"Be a student at the Akademiya? It would be pretty fun to see how the Akademiya's teachings differ from what the old folks say back home. I'll consider it.\""

After much asking around, they finally found out his name: Sethos.<!--\n              -->\"So, where did you meet again? He's an old friend of yours, right?\" People would ask each other such questions, before discovering to their surprise that none of them had known him for long.<!--\n              -->Like a grain of sand blown over the high city walls by some wild desert wind, Sethos blended into the crowd with ease, speaking with them of homelands and travels. People warmed to him immediately, for his unforgettable green eyes and way with words led them to believe he would make a good friend indeed.<!--\n              -->As the sun set, their new friend would regale them with the tale of how he and a group of Eremites had led Sumpter Beasts away from a sandstorm, setting up camp by an oasis to pass the night; of the desert night's bitter cold, and the euphoria of daybreak that made it all worth enduring.<!--\n              -->In Sethos's telling, suffering is merely another kind of experience, and all experiences can become stories; and the fonder people grew of his stories, the more they looked forward to seeing him.<!--\n              -->But one time, when his audience had collapsed on the tables in a drunken stupor, the still-sober Sethos was left sitting there spinning his cup.<!--\n              -->This is what he said:<!--\n              -->\"All of you are always saying I seem too ordinary in my stories. So how about this for a change... In this one, I am the protagonist, and with me I carry a golden key, which I may use at any moment to open a long-lost treasure trove and lead the people to a place of great mystery. There's no way you'd actually prefer a story like that, right?\"<!--\n              -->\"If you ask me, that kind of story is just boring. Stories of extraordinary things happening to ordinary people... those are the ones worth telling! Besides, even if mysterious, special individuals like that did exist, they wouldn't be as young as you.\" The tavern's owner just couldn't stop himself from interjecting.<!--\n              -->\"Exactly,\" replied Sethos, who for some reason looked particularly happy."

Had they, they would know that this was a young man who could run like no other; any who wished to keep up with him would have to run as fast as the wind.<!--\n              -->Sethos himself is very proud of this, and often remarks: \"You're gonna need some special skills if you want to survive in the desert, right? Mine's running, and running fast.\"<!--\n              -->Thanks to his fleetness of foot, those around him often entrust him with important errands — though strictly speaking, these aren't actual jobs, not even of the part-time variety. Things like delivering letters for bedridden elderly folks, or fetching homework for forgetful students who left it at home.<!--\n              -->He is repaid in all sorts of different ways. Some students give Mora and others buy him coffee, while others still have offered up their treasured Genius Invokation TCG cards as a token of their heartfelt appreciation.<!--\n              -->As for the older folks, their gifts have always been... more unique, shall we say. Aside from money, some even treat Sethos to a home-cooked meal, or dig up some old ornament to present to him as a gift.<!--\n              -->But the easy-going Sethos always accepts everything he is given. He adds it all to his collection, which he sorts by value: Mora, ornaments, useless odds and ends, Genius Invokation TCG cards, and everything else.<!--\n              -->A woman on Treasures Street once asked him, \"You never say no to any task! Don't tell me you actually enjoy running errands?\"<!--\n              -->Sethos loved eating the fried fish rolls she made. Apparently, aside from her own family and neighbors, the helpful Sethos, who lent a hand to her shop, was the only one on the entire street who had ever had the pleasure of tasting that delectable delicacy.<!--\n              -->Holding the meal box she'd just given him, Sethos stood there for quite some time, thinking the question through.<!--\n              -->\"Huh, you're right,\" he finally said, as if something had just dawned upon him. \"Come to think of it, I really do enjoy running errands.\"<!--\n              -->\"You don't want a better line of work? You seem to know a lot, and you're pretty capable, too... If you'd like, I could help you find a job?\" The woman sounded very concerned for him.<!--\n              -->Sethos simply waved his hand and pointed at a figure that was flying past in the distance. \"What do you think that person's doing?\"<!--\n              -->The woman looked up and saw a large, round object sailing by, with what appeared to be a person beneath it. In a tone of surprise, she replied, \"Isn't that another errand-runner?\"<!--\n              -->\"That's Hat Guy, a student from Vahumana who's known for his speed,\" said Sethos, raising his fork. \"But I've heard that sometimes, he also gets called on to deliver letters for the Akademiya.\"<!--\n              -->\"Do you mean that... that's just what he likes to do?\"<!--\n              -->\"No, no, I don't think he likes it, but I'm not like him. I'm a people person, and I enjoy running errands and taking on the easy tasks. And look, you even treated me to a meal! Besides, I've got a proper job too, so don't worry about me.\"<!--\n              -->Over the next few days, Sethos was busy with his own affairs. One day, as he passed by the side gate of the Akademiya to handle something, he suddenly heard a voice jeering at him from the treetops: \"The errand-boy's come running all the way to the Akademiya. Quite the busy little bee, aren't you?\"<!--\n              -->Perched up there on the branch was none other than Hat Guy himself. Smiling back, Sethos raised the lunchbox in his hand and smiled at him, saying, \"I'm just here for lunch — someone gave me this. Want some?\"<!--\n              -->\"I'd say you're no errand boy at all. You've got a more important role.\"<!--\n              -->\"I'd say that you're no student either. You've got a more important role.\"<!--\n              -->Sometimes, a few words are all it takes. Without another word, Hat Guy tugged the brim of his hat and vanished in an instant. As for who Sethos really was, or what this \"important role\" of his was... Well, there was no one around to hear their little exchange anyway, let alone care.<!--\n              -->Sethos took his time finding a spot with a good view where he could sit down and enjoy this free lunch of his, which he'd received for a multitude of reasons. Having the chance to meet all these different people, and receive all these gifts in return... He was quite satisfied that this was all thanks to his running ability."

The only one who did was the owner Lambad, who would say to his tavern's customers: \"It's the storyteller's own words! Do you think something like that's really possible?\"<!--\n              -->Most of those confronted with such questions could do little more than stare blankly at one another. Dori picked up her fork, complete with fish roll spiked on its tines, muttering: \"If it was, he'd be rich by now.\"<!--\n              -->\"Perhaps he's already become the leader of a tribe? Stories like that are those of the desert,\" rejoined Candace, who was sitting at the next table.<!--\n              -->Dehya, however, laughed, as the thought of someone sprang into her mind. Turning to Lambad, she quietly asked: \"And why not? You don't have to be old to have a mysterious background. Who knows, maybe they'd even be the type to drink here, and they'd even have to find a day job, too.\"<!--\n              -->At this very moment, Sethos was somewhere far, far away. His footsteps were light, despite the pack he was carrying. On the horizon, the sun was slowly sinking, the shadow of night rising through the distant sky. Seeing that the day was nearly spent, a look of fear was writ large upon the face of the Vahumana researcher he was traveling with. Looking at his employer, Sethos handed him some a flask of drinking water without saying a word.<!--\n              -->Sethos had considerately slowed down to a fraction of his usual pace so that the researcher would not fall behind. At night, employer and guide shared a single large tent. As Sethos set up the tent, the researcher sat warming himself by the fire Sethos had built, a look of gratitude spread over his face.<!--\n              -->\"You don't seem like you want for money. Why are you willing to guide people like me through the desert? You look like you've lived in the desert for quite some time, too.\"<!--\n              -->\"I had the time, and you needed the help, so I came along. I grew up in the desert, so I couldn't get into the Akademiya myself, and besides, I'm curious about what you're researching. So for me, serving as a guide and a guard for researchers is a chance to hear interesting new things.\"<!--\n              -->Sethos's expression was calm and composed, just as it was whenever he told stories, exposing nothing — and he looked quite sincere too. Faced with such sincerity, it was difficult for the researcher to refuse, so he began to recount some entertaining anecdotes about the Akademiya, with complaints about his classmates, colleagues, and research mixed in. Resting his chin on his palm, Sethos sat there listening intently, seemingly fascinated with the researcher's life.<!--\n              -->Over the next week, Sethos accompanied this little-known researcher as he completed his investigation, then seeing him safely back to the Akademiya. When the researcher handed over the payment, Sethos pocketed the money without so much as checking the amount, then walked back out of the entrance with a wave.<!--\n              -->As he did so, he just so happened to run into the General Mahamatra. As he looked at Sethos, and then at the now-distant researcher, Cyno knew exactly what had transpired.<!--\n              -->\"How's your side-gig going? Do you find their work interesting?\" asked Cyno.<!--\n              -->Following Cyno's lead, Sethos leaned against the railing and gazed out onto the sunset.<!--\n              -->\"It was alright. But these scholars are just so stubborn. He kept insisting that there must be a tribe of sages living in seclusion out there in the desert. I told him there was no way they'd be living next to the Mausoleum of King Deshret, but he just wouldn't believe me. In the end, I told him that the place I grew up was just like that, but he didn't believe that either.\"<!--\n              -->\"Tell him that Tighnari, Collei, Dehya, and myself can all vouch for the fact that you are, in fact, from that kind of place.\"<!--\n              -->Sethos sighed. \"Then he'd just think me a liar.

Their sole aim is one that is also truly sublime, and that is to steward the knowledge that should not find its way out into the world. Over the long centuries, the desert has experienced great turmoil. The Temple of Silence has fled from the devastation of war, taking with them all the knowledge they possessed as they moved from place to place. For a time, they came to the rainforest and worked with the Akademiya, but as they could not trust those wielding power in the Akademiya, they left. Finally, they found a place for themselves in a forgotten corner of the world.<!--\n              -->Sethos, the one who tells this story, is himself from the Temple of Silence. Despite his claims to be ordinary, he is anything but. Or perhaps an ordinary identity is how Sethos wishes to make up for his own life.<!--\n              -->Sethos was born in the desert. His mother is said to have been a merchant, and his father a mercenary, and a number of clues have led some to conjecture that they must originally have come from a desert tribe with a tiny population. But alas, it is unfortunate that Sethos has no memory of his birth parents. As far back as he can remember, he was already in the care of Bamoun, living in the Temple of Silence as his adoptive grandson.<!--\n              -->After some years, it was discovered that Sethos's special constitution was capable of receiving a Ba fragment of Hermanubis. As a result of this, he was indwelt by a great power with which he established a sacred connection.<!--\n              -->The other whose childhood experiences were similar to his — Cyno, the General Mahamatra — had long gained the admiration of Sumeru's people. But Sethos didn't want to become a famed, high-profile figure like Cyno. Therefore, after arriving in Sumeru City, he chose to live in anonymity, assuming the most ordinary of ordinary identities.<!--\n              -->He found a place to live and invented a perfectly normal and reasonable-sounding family background for himself. Sometimes, he serves as a desert guide, while others, he helps merchant caravans with this and that. When he is bored, he can be found in various locales, chatting with friends to pass the time.<!--\n              -->Of course, that is when he is free; things are very different when he is busy. Lesser Lord Kusanali sometimes invites him to meet with the sages to discuss various issues that arise as they work together — for Sethos has now succeeded Bamoun as the leader of the Temple of Silence, and under his leadership, the Temple has once again established a collaborative relationship with the Akademiya.<!--\n              -->On the one hand, a perfectly ordinary new resident of Sumeru City; on the other, the new leader of the Temple of Silence. Both of these identities are his, despite the apparent gulf between them.<!--\n              -->If you were to ask him which life he preferred, however, rather than choosing between them, he would simply reply: \"Ah, come on now, there's no need for that! Making unnecessary choices is such a tiring way to live! Think about it, you wouldn't force someone to choose between a bottle of liquor and a cup of coffee, would you? Aren't they both me?\""

It took him many years to understand what the Temple of Silence meant for the world.<!--\n              -->As the leader of such an organization, how heavy was the burden that Bamoun had borne? Sethos believed he knew, yet still found it difficult to imagine.<!--\n              -->The Bamoun that Sethos remembers is not the stern, upright leader, but rather the kind, patient grandfather. When Bamoun still had his health, he would often take Sethos into the desert.<!--\n              -->Camping, exploring, hunting... if it was fun, they did it; and it was during this period of his life that Sethos learned how to cook, navigate, and set up camp, all thanks to his grandfather's patient guidance.<!--\n              -->At that time, Sethos was a very mischievous child.

You don't think I'd actually bring something like that out here with us, do you?\"<!--\n              -->The ancient texts cared for by the Temple of Silence are of the utmost importance, and even the leader cannot remove them without good cause. Most of the books that Bamoun brought with him were from his personal collection, while others he purchased from desert merchants.<!--\n              -->Grandfather and grandson would huddle together, reading through the texts one word at a time. When Sethos could not understand, he would sit there scribbling silently away in the sand, writing out riddles he had read about or proverbs that others had told him from memory.<!--\n              -->One time, he asked Bamoun: \"What's a rabbit?\"<!--\n              -->Bamoun replied: \"The prey of beasts; the nemesis of hay.\"<!--\n              -->He followed this up with: \"What's a flying serpent then?\"<!--\n              -->Bamoun chuckled for a moment, then replied, \"It is a creature who blessed you. The priest said that you would have the dexterity of the fox and the agility of the flying serpent.\"<!--\n              -->After night had passed and not long after dawn, Sethos would arrive at the top of the hill with the various weapons that he was carrying. In this place, he would hone his combat skills — first ranged, then melee. Archery was taught by several other figures; but it was Bamoun himself who taught him how to fight with a polearm.<!--\n              -->Sethos asked Bamoun: \"Is this your favorite weapon, Grandpa?\"<!--\n              -->Bamoun replied: \"It is the one for which I am best suited. The polearm is the hallmark of a skilled warrior and the emblem of the brave. Even Cyrus fought with a polearm, though whether he may be considered a brave warrior... That is another question.\"<!--\n              -->Sethos did not wait to hear what his grandfather might say about that, but he could tell from his expression that he did not think Cyrus was a coward. In fact, that was precisely why he hesitated.<!--\n              -->Later, Sethos acquired a polearm of his own. Interestingly, it was clear at a glance that it had not been made by any desert dweller. Bamoun did not tell him where it had originally come from, saying only that it had been left behind by Cyrus, and that as it was a fine weapon, no harm in putting it to use.<!--\n              -->Sethos was sharp enough that from then on, he had a vague sense of the deeper meaning behind Bamoun's words.<!--\n              -->There were many times when he had thought to himself: Did Bamoun really hate Cyrus? But perhaps his apparent distaste was simply a way of complaining about the fact that his friend had left. If you actually hated someone, you wouldn't hold on to their old possessions. Yet from the ordinary way that Bamoun had brought out and presented him with the polearm, you would have thought that there was nothing special about it at all.<!--\n              -->What the Temple of Silence needed was what Bamoun needed; yet Bamoun's feelings were his own, and were not those of the Temple. As its leader, it was only right that he should hate someone like Cyrus. But as a friend, perhaps he was glad that Cyrus had shown the courage that he had.<!--\n              -->Such contradictions would not, and could not, persist indefinitely. There would inevitably come a day when his grandfather would find some way of resolving his little differences with the Temple.<!--\n              -->Trimming down branches to help the tree keep growing — that was the type of person Bamoun was. Yet even if he would always remain that kind, patient figure in Sethos's heart, he still carried the burden of bloodshed.<!--\n              -->The next person Bamoun sacrificed would be himself. Sethos understood that Bamoun too knew his grandson would figure this out sooner or later.<!--\n              -->Thus did grandfather and grandson reach a silent understanding — that a day would come when they would no longer be an ordinary grandfather and adoptive grandson, but instead two individuals standing at the crossroads of history."

    "text": "On many nights, Sethos's stories return to the same word: \"Friend.\"<!--\n              -->\"Friends\" appear in all corners of his stories, each varying in appearance, age, gender, and identity. Sethos never mentions them by name, saying only that: \"My friends are all good people. Without them, it's hard to exaggerate how dull my life would be.\"<!--\n              -->The General Mahamatra Cyno might be considered to be Sethos's first friend. Strictly speaking, they've known each other for a very long time indeed. Sethos had already spoken to him during those years when Cyno was still with the Temple of Silence. Later on, the two of them underwent the same test, having Ba fragments implanted and losing a portion of their memories as a result. Cyno's reaction was much more severe, causing him to almost completely forget that he had ever lived at the Temple of Silence; whereas Sethos had not been so badly affected, losing only some memories related to people.<!--\n              -->He couldn't tell you exactly what he'd forgotten. Perhaps his birth parents, or the faces of his childhood friends. Fortunately, with the exception of Cyno, all of his childhood friends lived at the Temple of Silence, so learning what they looked like again wasn't difficult. And despite the fact that they had forgotten each other, he and Cyno were later to meet again, after which they struck up a true friendship. This pleased Sethos very much, who likes to call Cyno his \"bro.\"<!--\n              -->After Sethos left the desert, his \"bro\" Cyno's close friend Tighnari also became an important friend of his. Living in Avidya Forest, this Tighnarian Forest Watcher had an endless stock of stories about the forest, its plants, and the people who would get lost in it. Coming from the desert, where such greenery was practically nonexistent, Sethos was full of curiosity about Tighnari's life and work. Sometimes, he and Cyno would go over to Tighnari's place to mooch a meal, and he'd even compete with Collei to see who was better at setting up a camp.<!--\n              -->Not long after, he also made friends with the reliable mercenary Dehya, as well as Candace, the Guardian of Aaru Village. Candace even invited Sethos to visit Aaru Village, telling the residents that he was a \"traveler\" from the heart of the desert.<!--\n              -->Seeing his bemused look, Candace replied, \"You're so busy, rushing here and there every day, so I thought that was the best way to describe you. It must be a wonderful way to live, able to walk on your chosen path...\"<!--\n              -->It was a still, cloudless day when Sethos returned to the Temple of Silence.<!--\n              -->He assigned matters that needed to be addressed to those there, and he had also brought back many rainforest specialties to share with his people. Among the members of the Temple of Silence, there were many who had never been to the rainforest, so it was a real treat for them to see such unfamiliar things.<!--\n              -->Once official matters had been settled, Sethos got out his old waterskin, his favorite lyre, and a leaf from Avidya Forest, then set off. He spent that night by the fire he lit beside Bamoun's tomb.<!--\n              -->He was not sad, nor was he confused — he simply wanted to return to the place where his grandfather had raised him. Being by Bamoun's side gave him an unparalleled sense of calm.<!--\n              -->\"My friend picked this leaf for me. There's nothing special about it, really. I just thought it looked beautiful, and I wanted to show you.\"<!--\n              -->\"Oh yeah, and another friend called me a 'traveler.' What do you think about that, Grandpa? Whenever you claimed to be a traveler, everyone used to say you hadn't been to enough places. But now I have. Plus, I have plenty of free time, so I guess that makes me more of a traveler than you ever were.\"<!--\n              -->With this, he threw the leaf into the fire. The flames leapt up for a moment, almost as if a hand were gently waving back at him.<!--\n              -->With a smile, Sethos gave the firewood a prod and smiled. \"Excellent, I'll take that as a yes.\""

It is said that some tribes reward their warriors with high-quality waterskins. Though Bamoun did not say it to Sethos in so many words, he gave it to him after the latter shot a faraway bird out of the sky while it was in mid-flight.<!--\n              -->The strap of the waterskin bears his name, engraved by his grandfather's own hands."

    "text": "Normally, a hunt only begins in the wake of a disaster. But sometimes, there are exceptions.<!--\n              -->Due to a companion's mistake, Sethos, Bamoun, and two other members of the Temple of Silence found themselves surrounded by wild beasts. They fought the pack for an entire night, managing to slay several of their number just before dawn.<!--\n              -->In this encounter, Sethos fought with energy and courage. He knew that Bamoun, being advanced in years and having previously sustained injuries in various battles in the past, was no longer up to the task of taking charge of battles out in the wilds. So as the sun rose on the second day, the first arrow to pierce a beast's skull came from the bow of Sethos.<!--\n              -->But his arrows, tearing through the swift wind like drops of water falling into a pan of hot oil, simply ignited a fresh round of even fiercer fighting.<!--\n              -->Yet in the space of a moment, the ground suddenly began to shift. The beasts, who were focused on hunting down their human prey, failed to notice; and by the time they did, they were already caught in the quicksand, several being swallowed up in an instant.<!--\n              -->Sethos led the others to higher ground, using a rope and other tools to climb up to the highest nearby point as swiftly as they could. Of course, the beasts that had not yet been engulfed by the quicksand discovered this refuge too, and threw themselves at it, only to be shot down one by one by Sethos's arrows.<!--\n              -->After a moment of chaos, the surviving beasts fled, and the surviving people breathed a sigh of relief. But at that very moment, a storm bore down upon them, and within a short while, it hit them with its full force.<!--\n              -->In the raging wind, Sethos could barely keep hold of the three others. In desperation, he tied the rope around their waists, tethered the other end to himself, and clung to the back of the rocky mountainside with all his strength.<!--\n              -->He knew not how long it took, but the roaring sound of the wind finally came to a stop. Holding on as tightly as he could, Sethos slowly pulled the others back to his side.<!--\n              -->After observing the weather to ensure it was safe, they returned the way they had come. Along the way, Sethos spotted two more beasts — one large, one small — lying dead at the bottom of a cliff.<!--\n              -->Looking at them from a distance, Bamoun remarked, \"Most likely a parent and a child. The larger one was probably chasing the smaller one, trying to drag it back, before it too lost its footing and they were blown down together.\"<!--\n              -->\"They were with that pack of beasts just now... But weren't there quite a few smaller ones? This large one died trying to save just a single one, and now the other small ones will be left unprotected. The losses far outweigh the gains... It shouldn't have taken the risk,\" said one of the other members, shaking their head.<!--\n              -->Trying to rescue your children first from quicksand, then a storm... It sounded like an almost impossible task. Sethos had noticed, though, that Bamoun had been staring at that spot the whole time, as if it had reminded him of something. But in the end he said nothing more.<!--\n              -->Having survived the disaster, the group slowly departed, with Sethos bringing up the rear. Before leaving, Sethos glanced back down at the scene below to regard the unsuccessful beast one last time.<!--\n              -->Having just experienced a genuine life-or-death situation, he now felt an additional weight in his pocket — a Vision. But in moments like that, the chain of events that led up to it happening seemed irrelevant; sometimes, the only thing people could see was the end result.<!--\n              -->Sethos gripped the Vision tightly through the fabric of his pocket, reflecting calmly yet deeply upon this truth."

She calls upon every flame of Natlan, uniting all fires into a bright light to drive away the darkness.\nAs we support each other, stumbling through the valley of the long, boundless night, wiping the tears from the corners of our eyes, and finally struggle to lift up our heavy heads—\nWe see naught but that unwavering, unchanging red, like the sun rising in the east.\nWhat did she sacrifice? What did she give up? What kind of will has led her to this day?\nWe have no doubt that she will lead Natlan to yet another victory.\nOur Sun will never set."

Even newly-arrived travelers need only hear her speak at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame to know that she merits being known as the sun.<!--\n              -->She is exceedingly awe-inspiring, but is no unsmiling ruler whose ways may as well be set in stone. In informal situations, she is an enthusiastic and friendly big-sister figure, always ready to chat, and ever open to reasonable suggestions.<!--\n              -->On the eve of the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, the Weary Inn is often packed with passionate revelers, and Mavuika can often be found there, playing cards or singing songs with everyone, and even if some drunk person splashes their drink onto her, she doesn't mind at all.<!--\n              -->After all, for someone who can ignite their hair to dry off said drink, such incidents are small beans. When such levity is hard to come by, why let something so minor spoil the mood?<!--\n              -->But should the person intend to start a drinking contest, it is Mavuika's desire to win that will be kindled. As the \"battle\" has begun, there can be no room for retreat or surrender. The victor will be determined, one way or the other.<!--\n              -->Since becoming Archon, her habits have remained utterly unchanged, and this has allowed her to make many friends across the tribes.<!--\n              -->However, not everyone possesses the subtle sense of proper propriety for such a relationship. Indeed, she can be too down-to-earth, and with her lack of airs, some misjudge the situation and get the false impression that they can use their friendship with an Archon to their own benefit.<!--\n              -->Strangely enough, though people of this sort are a dime a dozen, they have never caused any major trouble, for Mavuika has never responded to such ridiculous requests — a solemn, icy stare is all she needs to send the other party scampering away.<!--\n              -->The sight of those ever-burning eyes casting such a frigid gaze wakes those confused fools up in an instant to the fact that Mavuika is still the leader of a nation, a supreme deity.<!--\n              -->A Speaker's Chamber staff member once suggested that she should subject those who so harass her to at least token punishment, lest there be an endless stream of incidents to come, but she refused.<!--\n              -->\"Archonhood is status, authority, and a spiritual symbol.

    "text": "Theoretically, anyone in Natlan can become the Pyro Archon, so long as they prove that they are the mightiest warrior of their era during a Pilgrimage.<!--\n              -->Therefore, the rulers of the nation have varied wildly in personality and style. Some worshipped power and strength, valuing results. To them, any price was acceptable so long as the ends could be achieved.<!--\n              -->Mavuika is just the opposite. In the eyes of others, she is undoubtedly your typical \"perfectionist\" — not only must things be done well, but also beautifully.<!--\n              -->To pursue quality and completeness is only human, but doing so often requires extra time. And whenever anyone tells her that such an approach isn't efficient enough, Mavuika has a set of arguments at the ready.<!--\n              -->First, there are no standalone events in this world. Tracing events backward reveals causes, while moving forward reveals outcomes. Humans are incapable of analyzing the whole chain of events. All they can do is handle each one as best they can, and avoid leaving hidden pitfalls.<!--\n              -->Second, all past events become valuable experiences. Successes serve as references, and failures as lessons. But if matters were dealt with carelessly, all they will leave are warnings to not repeat the same mistakes.<!--\n              -->But apart from these two ideas, Mavuika also has a very important reason for her approach that she rarely ever mentions — and that is \"fun.\"<!--\n              -->She has a broad range of hobbies, and has unparalleled skill in the various sports and games popular across the tribes, but one sentence can sum up all of these interests — she loves getting better at things.<!--\n              -->For example, when she first learned how to rock climb, she would commit every movement her coach made to memory and ask in detail about every last maneuver.<!--\n              -->Her next step was to train — and train a lot, making her body remember the trick behind each movement, gradually executing them faster and faster. She even requested someone to record the entire process with a Kamera, all the better to later study any failures or areas where she wasn't fluid enough.<!--\n              -->She would also talk with her coach and use various tools and equipment in order to solve problems she encountered, enumerating lists of solutions, and trying out each one in turn before choosing the best.<!--\n              -->In this way, Mavuika honed her climbing skills to perfection most quickly indeed, and her questions grew ever harder for her coach to answer, eventually shifting their relationship from that of teacher and student to that of fellow lovers of climbing, delving into their craft together.<!--\n              -->In other fields, there were even more exaggerated cases. In some cases, Mavuika would come to surpass \"masters\" with three to four decades of experience after just a single year of study.<!--\n              -->The reason behind this was actually quite simple: Building up skills is easy, but maintaining progress is hard. Once memories have sunk into one's body, it becomes easy for one to grow self-satisfied and complacent, and thus cease to actively think.<!--\n              -->As such, one thing Mavuika detests is repetition: If a deed done before must be done again, then it must be done differently in some way, whether by trying something new, or else through reflection and optimization.<!--\n              -->But it is difficult for most to see all the effort that she puts into this, and thus, her swift progress is often put down to talent. To this, she can only wryly smile, for who in this world was born with such a surfeit of talent?<!--\n              -->\"If you want to improve, all you have to do is master the 'skill' of improvement and then just put in the work.\""

When not at work or training, she can be seen in all sorts of places, throwing herself at various extreme challenges.<!--\n              -->But what people often fail to realize is that she actually can also sit still for long periods of time, staying focused as she reads books and woven scrolls, as she possesses ample patience.<!--\n              -->Her other great indoor hobby is solving puzzles, whether these involve logical reasoning or pattern recognition, and regardless if their contents are images, numbers, or even stories. All quickly suck her into a world of her own.<!--\n              -->After enjoying time well-spent making deductions and decisions, she even scores these puzzles based on their quality, difficulty, and reasonability, so that her fellow puzzle hobbyists have a reliable standard to refer to.<!--\n              -->Yet this hobby of hers came to pose a problem: Puzzle games are usually one-time sources of enjoyment and lack replayability, and Mavuika tends to solve them all too quickly, faster even than the ability of puzzle creators to develop new ones.<!--\n              -->As such, while keeping an eye on any new puzzles that come to market, Mavuika also dusts off already-solved puzzles and adds various restrictions and limitations to increase the difficulty or complexity.<!--\n              -->For example, while doing a puzzle, she might allow herself to select pieces normally, but flip the pieces when placing them, thus only being able to see if she has the puzzle right after placing every piece and flipping the whole thing back over.<!--\n              -->Or perhaps, if the puzzle requires separating multiple connected pieces of metal, she will affix one piece to the table, thus restricting the number of directions in which she can conveniently pull the pieces apart, requiring her to consider alternatives — a restriction that can also be applied to knot puzzles.<!--\n              -->Over time, she has compiled the various gameplay challenges she has come up with and puzzle ratings she has given, creating a most valuable curated catalog of puzzles.<!--\n              -->At first, she published it at the Speaker's Chamber, hoping that she could help her fellow hobbyists, and also promote this relatively niche hobby while she was at it, but the quickest to seize upon the utility of the resource she created were, in fact, the sellers of puzzles.<!--\n              -->They used the recommendation of the Pyro Archon herself to shamelessly peddle their puzzles, but this quickly led to numerous disputes — approval though it be, Mavuika's catalog only indicated her personal preference, while the full scope of human taste in puzzles is vast indeed.<!--\n              -->Following that incident, Mavuika no longer publicly discloses her catalog, but if one truly considers oneself a puzzle enthusiast, one can still go to the Speaker's Chamber and request to view it.<!--\n              -->...With the caveat that you must first prove yourself an expert by solving a random puzzle selected from Mavuika's collection by the Chamber staff, of course."

As this repeated time and again, her mother came to realize how her own reckless behavior must have seemed inappropriate in the eyes of others.<!--\n              -->Mavuika matured faster than any other child her age, and very quickly, the knowledge she had gleaned from her father allowed her to point out her mother's rashness, and the experiences she had with her mother allowed her to identify her father's overly idealistic thinking.<!--\n              -->Like a bridge, she stood between two people who could not at first communicate easily with one another, slowly dissolving the many contradictions and misunderstandings that had accumulated over time. When her father taught her martial arts, her mother would give pointers from the side, and when her mother took her to train Saurians, her father would also come along.<!--\n              -->But the thing that really pushed Mavuika to take another step forward was the birth of another angel into the house — her sister, Hine.<!--\n              -->Perhaps it was because Mavuika had already taken on responsibilities important to the family's relationships that she quickly got used to the role of an older sister, and step by step, she passed on all that she had learned from her parents to Hine.<!--\n              -->Hine was by no means easy to handle.

She brought also ideas with which to solve the problems involved — long had she been scouring Natlan for all manner of strangely-shaped Source Mechanisms as yet uncorrupted by the Abyss, along with various design blueprints of unknown provenance.<!--\n              -->In the distant past, the ancient dragons too had tried to fight against the Abyss.

In the process, they discovered that their original assumptions were too simplistic. It was impossible to get all the key components they needed from existing material.<!--\n              -->The solution, then, was to use modern smithing techniques to create said parts independently and combine the two elements — a process that involved lots of overheating and explosions en route to solving the Pyro compatibility issue that Source Mechanisms had.<!--\n              -->After a long period of development, the prototype Flamestrider was at last complete. No one had ever seen such a beastly creation with such powerful capabilities before, and people lined up to see and applaud it.<!--\n              -->Thus did the leader who protects Natlan gain yet another guaranteed source of strength.<!--\n              -->Also worth mentioning is the fact that Xilonen declined to take part in the vehicle testing phase that followed, claiming that she had \"forgotten to make a second helmet.\" After all, sitting on the back of that thing while Mavuika is driving is a great way to end up feeling queasy."

Even when night has fallen and the world has gone to sleep, one can still hear the sounds of her bow being drawn echoing through the dojo.On the battlefield, she has always been at the tip of the spear, leading the troops with absolute heroism and awe-inspiring fighting spirit.When the dust has settled, she will also personally see to the wounded, and give reward and mete out punishment based on merit. Every step of the battle that passes through her hands is managed well, with missteps being very few and far between.Sara's troops are all witnesses to her words and deeds.

To Sara, however, these are just differences in form.There was a time when a sizable spate of thefts was reported to the police station in quick succession, and they could not find the culprit. Walking through the woods on higher alert than usual, Sara quickly espied the bake-danuki running along hurriedly while carrying their plunder.Of course, bake-danuki are not evil by nature, but only steal food out of gluttony.Capturing the creatures, Sara had only this to say as she reclaimed their ill-gotten gains:\"Hiding in the mountains will not let you escape judgment. Listen closely, for this is your final warning. Do not make yourself a nuisance to civilians again, or else...\"The bake-danuki were chilled to the bone, nodding as they balled up in a corner. After this, they would keep to that agreement and did not again do such ill.As for the sharp-tongued Sara, she would bring various melons and fruits that could keep for a longer period up to the mountains while training there, making sure to deposit them in the bake-danuki's dwelling whenever she passed through.She did not explain herself, and in any case, did not consider this any sort of gift.

I did not take you in just to have you do such pointless things.\"Since then, Sara would be conscientious in maintaining a certain distance from others. Rather than blending in with the crowd, she sought first to attain surpassing martial prowess, bearing in mind at all times that she would someday take command.\"The Raiden Shogun's helper. An example to the Tenryou Commission. The pride of the Clan Head.\"None of these three identities put her first in any way. But to Sara, this was her. She was a warrior whose being was calm and austerity.No one ever told her that she should give herself more consideration, and Sara did not necessarily lack such concerns either.Her chains as an adopted child and the solitude of a non-human had always accompanied her mission and status.But to stop due to such obstacles is the dilemma of the weak, and being Kujou Sara, her path would not end here.

This became something of a hot topic for a while.Sara would make no retort concerning any such stories. From her perspective, she bought that item with pious respect in her heart.In all matters related to the Shogun, she had never once committed a perfunctory or negligent act. Indeed, she went forth personally to select and purchase a statue and even personally prepared a shrine within which it might be kept upon her return.She placed five such statues in specially-placed display cases, and would clean them whenever she returned home. If she could not be there, she would arrange for artisans to perform that maintenance instead...To someone like Sara who lacks friends and who is too busy to have much of a private life, the Raiden Shogun is not merely a deity, but also a form of repose.The Shogun is her will, her future, her strength... even the harbinger of her fate — the confluence of all that is noble. Sara's adherence is one born out of recognition and trust.The intricately-made Archon statue makes Sara feel like the Almighty Shogun is not far off in her Tenshukaku, but is a wisdom, an ideal, a strength of heart that supports her every step of the way.These moments of tranquility bring her indescribable enjoyment."

It can't end like this! I... I always believed that I could protect this place forever with my strength...\"When day dawned the next day, some passers-by discovered an unconscious girl by the roadside. She looked a little worse for the wear but seemed otherwise unharmed, adding to the mystery of how she had ended up here.Astonished, the people brought her back to the city and reported the matter to the Tenryou Commission immediately.That was when the Kujou Clan Head, Kujou Takayuki, noticed that the glowing item in her hand was a Vision — a thing that many desired but few ever gained.Realizing that she had gained the attention of an Archon even at her young age, Takayuki believed that she was a destined child, sent to the Tenryou Commission by the heavens.Taking her in, he named her \"Sara,\" and would train her to become an all-around warrior, asking that she serve the Shogun and fight for Inazuma.Kujou Takayuki believed that in raising such an excellent general, the status and future of the Kujou Clan would become more secure. And indeed, all that he had hoped would steadily come to pass.Sara, armed with her Vision, would swiftly distinguish herself, rising through the ranks to become a general of the Tenryou Commission at a young age, just as many had hoped.Yet it was precisely because she possessed a Vision that Sara knew this better than anyone: her surviving that fall unscathed was due to the Archon looking upon her with favor in that instant.In but a single glance, she had been given the power that sustained her life. Everything she had, therefore, could be described as existing by the Almighty Shogun's grace.Fighting for the Shogun...Sara believed that this was neither her duty nor a result of her foster father's schemes, but was instead her truest calling."

Let's be real here, but does Morax really know everything?\"The Liyue Qixing deal with the day-to-day happenings in the Harbor, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year.While history has shown that following Morax's lead has been the right call, Keqing believes that humans should have their own pride, and that their views deserve equal importance.As such, she often advocates different opinions from Rex Lapis, and is the first to put such views into practice.Her radical actions have seen stellar results, but they have also attracted murmurings of opprobrium among those devoted to Rex Lapis.As Keqing sees it, such opposition are the excuses of those who have grown complacent under the aegis of their deity, and who cannot consider the future of humanity of their own accord.But someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and create a new path with their own hands — and the Yuheng star is determined to do her part in this endeavor."

    "text": "Keqing is the daughter of an illustrious Liyue family with a proud lineage, and she is better acquainted than most with the influence that Rex Lapis has over the people of Liyue.Once every few years, in an almost cyclical fashion, a major reshuffle hits Liyue's economy after the Rite of Descension.Once Rex Lapis' new policies are announced, some families celebrate while other grieve. The poor hope it will offer them the chance to finally make their fortunes while the wealthy pray that theirs will not be swept away in the changing tides.Rather than carefully analyzing the economic climate, merchants are more prone to making investments based on belief.And in present-day Liyue, this is a forgivable strategy: Rex Lapis is a powerful deity and he can be relied on for all things.But Keqing has her reservations about all this: What if, one day, Rex Lapis stops fulfilling his duty? Then what would become of the people of Liyue?Liyue's present prosperity is akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach — humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.However, Keqing has been unable to garner majority support for her views. From most people's perspective, life is but a brief insignificant moment in Liyue's long history, and there is no point in working oneself up into an existential quandary.This perspective, as far as Keqing is concerned, is a lazy and cowardly one that denies there is any value at all in the existence of the human race. \"If humans really have no value,\" Keqing retorts, \"then why should we expect the gods to care about us so much?\"Unwilling to compromise on her beliefs, she cast her skepticism on everything — everything from Rex Lapis' loving-kindness, to the people's laziness, to the way that society runs.Issues affecting humans' fate should be handled by humans, and humans are more capable of handling them with finesse.Finally, the day came of her now-famous speech at the Rite of Descension.\"Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?\"On hearing these words, Rex Lapis burst into hearty laughter. But as for what exactly he was laughing about, only Rex Lapis himself knows."

    "text": "Some may be able to keep up with Keqing's forward-thinking ideas, but none can keep up with her pace of work.Perhaps in an effort to become a role model for her people, she demands of herself to work ten times harder than the average person, and she cannot abide by any measure of laziness or inefficiency.Humans' abilities and lifespans are more limited than the gods'. This means that one has no hope of living to see the day when humans replace the gods as masters of our own universe if one allows apathy and hesitation to slow themselves down.Because of this same mindset, she is never able to synchronize her work rhythm with the people around her. Whatever the task, she does not rest until the job is done, and when something should take half the month to resolve, she will pull out all the stops to try and get it turned around within the next 48 hours.Additionally, Keqing's notion of \"completing\" something is far more ambitious than simply getting it \"finished\" — she will make sure that every relevant detail is tied up too. To the outside observer, she seems to be both highly efficient and a perfectionist.But not everyone is as self-motivated as Keqing, No assistant she hires ever makes it past the three-month mark. She has received countless remonstrations urging her to be less impatient, but she meets each one with a stern rejection. Still, she has, to some extent, come around to the idea that high staff turnover is itself a manifestation of inefficiency, and made some concessions accordingly.Today, if you encounter an assistant of Keqing's dealing with some matter three, four, or even five years ahead of time, don't be alarmed, this is completely normal. Keqing gave them a bit of a head start, but she'll be catching up before long."

But to be able to think and act as swiftly as lightning, one needs a huge amount of experience to draw on.So, if Keqing sees something that needs doing, why, she'll do it herself. For example, she once served for two months as a laborer to better decide how to refine a plan to improve their treatment.It's hard to imagine that this young lady with so much authority vested in her has pulled carts at the Chasm, rammed earth at the south wharf, and waited tables at small diners.In addition to working, she also once took the opportunity to gather evidence with which to report a powerful individual known for his abuses.He was apprehended without any clue as to how he had been exposed, but when he was brought to the interrogation chamber by the Millelith, there he saw a striking young lady dressed in fine robes.\"Hey! Haven't we... haven't we met somewhere before?\" The words felt foolish the moment they rolled off his tongue, even to him.Especially because the Millelith then introduced her as follows: \"This is the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing.

All the duties Rex once fulfilled have been taken up by the Qixing and the Eight Trades.Now that divine rule is a thing of the past, the old strictures left behind can't simply be continued wholesale. But to establish new laws for Liyue, whose history spans several thousand years, is no mean feat.At first, Keqing was incredibly enthusiastic about this task, having long prepared for this day when she might finally show her mettle. But several months in, and she was still stuck on a single task, land infrastructure — and it was driving her up the wall.No matter how hard she struggled, the mountain of tasks was like a quagmire. She was making a difference, yes, but not nearly with as much ease as Rex Lapis.\"Why can I only do this much? Why... can't I do it better?\" Of course, she had long understood the wherefores here. Her lack of respect for the gods had somehow received their recognition all the same, yes, but that didn't mean that she was ready to simply replace them.But she was still Keqing, resolute and tenacious. From that day on, she shut herself in, studying classics of various kinds to learn all that she needed. Placing herself lowest, she accepted all that she had hitherto not known with open arms.During this period, she gained a certain calm, slowly discarding the \"opprobrium\" she had long held against Rex Lapis.They were both working for the good of Liyue, after all — and two people who love the same thing need not be on opposing sides.She also seemingly came to an understanding concerning the smile Rex Lapis had given her during the Rite of Descension. It was, Keqing now believes, an expression of acknowledgement and expectation.She hasn't lost any of her forceful and decisive manner, no. But sometimes, when she feels lost, she will stop and think: \"What would Rex Lapis do at a moment such as this?\""

So, after glancing around to make sure that no one was watching, she paid for, picked up, and packed away her prize in one swift single movement.But no sooner had she placed the figurine into her bag and heaved a sigh of relief than one of her friends, silk bundles in tow, tapped her on the shoulder. In the end, all was revealed. Her friends were quite curious: Wasn't Keqing a skeptic among skeptics? Why would she buy one of these?\"For... For introspection, of course! There's nothing wrong with self-reflection, is there?\" So she said, and it would be convincing, too — if Keqing didn't already have an entire shelf dedicated to Rex Lapis self-reflection memorabilia..."

As long as it is infused with Electro, a hairpin can become a knife with unmatched sharpness.Cutting grass, chopping firewood, skinning game and carving bone are all well within its capabilities.If faced with a drop of great height, she only needs to pin it into the ground, tie rattans to it, and rappel down.It also serves as an incredibly sensitive security device when camping out. Any unusual movements nearby will cause it, when tipped over and placed perpendicular to the ground, to alert and awaken Keqing immediately.It can be used to fish: Keqing just hurls it into the water when she's feeling peckish, and there will always be a few fish that will get knocked out by the electric shock — and of course, finding a stick to grill the fish on is not a problem either.Some narrow-minded folk have ridiculed Keqing's hairpin for being old and worn, but this does not anger her.

She realized that this item did not actually have any divine will imbued within it, and indeed had numerous practical uses, and as such chose to use it.\"The source of power is far less important than the character of its user.\"Regardless of how she may once have regarded it, Keqing's Vision and its powers have become a part of her.Thank the Archons she hadn't destroyed it back then, or she'd have regretted it for sure — oh, the hardships of being a pragmatist."

Skilled, dextrous, and creative are but a few words that could be used to describe them.Lan Yan is a master rattan weaver and a Chenyu Vale Artisans Association member.Should a wandering traveler get lost in the tranquil valley, betwixt sparkling mountain springs and gnarled and ancient tea trees, and there stumble upon a smiling young woman, adorned in silver ornaments, it might well be Lan Yan, out collecting rattan vines.Feel free to ask her for directions, for she will kindly guide you through the swirling mountain mists of Chenyu Vale and set you on the path to the picturesque hamlet of Qiaoying Village, with its white brick walls and gray tiled roofs."

    "text": "Chenyu Vale has long been praised as a cradle of artisans, with many a master craftsperson honing their skills in the picturesque surroundings of Qiaoying Village.With generations of artisans living and working together, the village tradespeople naturally chose to form a collective to protect their shared interests. Now, they proudly announce themselves as members of the Chenyu Vale Artisans Association, spreading prestige for their hometown and their skills everywhere they go.Members of the association not only look out for each other in crafting and trade, but they form a close-knit, neighborly group who are always there for each other in good times and in bad.Ask any member of the association about rattan weaving, and one name above all you would hear — Lan Yan. Despite her youth, she excels at weaving all manner of rattan goods while also having a grasp on the arcane Qimen arts.It is said that \"skills honed to the highest pinnacle produce art that touches the divine realm.\" The venerable masters believe that anyone who reaches the apex of their craft will uncover abilities that cut through the spiritual divide. To them, Lan Yan — with her Vision and attunement to the Qimen arts — is a truly remarkable young woman.As for Lan Yan herself, well, she's having none of it. When others shower her with praise, this is her usual, slightly abashed retort: \"I'm really only interested in rattan weaving.\"A merchant from Liyue Harbor once came bearing gifts of gold and words of praise. He humbly requested that \"Lan Yan the Master Rattan Weaver\" produce two pieces of furniture for his new home.While waiting patiently in the association's halls, he had expected to be greeted by a serious, even taciturn face — one perhaps wizened by age. Yet when Lan Yan entered, he was shocked to discover a bright-eyed, fresh-faced young woman.Her joy and exuberance were evident as she greeted all those present with glee. There was no hint of arrogance in her demeanor. When the merchant told her of his request, she simply nodded and said, \"Leave it to me!\" as though her craft was as simple as pouring a cup of tea. With that, she shouldered her basket and headed out into the hills to pick the necessary vines.The artisan tasked with greeting the association's guests patted the merchant on the shoulder. \"Lan Yan's a straightforward young craftswoman, there's no need to stand on ceremony with her. She agreed to your request, so, the way she sees it, why not get started? Come on, let's go and get something to snack on while you wait.\""

    "text": "To Lan Yan's mind, the process of weaving rattan goods is a simple one.The first step is to gather enough vines.In the verdant mountains, the first rays of the morning sun are the purest, and as the last birds to rise lend their voices to the dawn chorus, Lan Yan sets off towards the wooded slopes with her trusty bamboo basket and pruning knife in hand.The vines like to grow where the soil is moist, though whether they prefer to bask in the sunlight or take shelter in the shade appears to be a matter of temperament and personal preference.Different vines are suited to the weaving of different objects. A folding screen, for example, requires a certain stubborn resilience. Lan Yan often looks for such vines in old-growth forests, with their ancient trees towering high overhead — to climb and cling on to such imposing trees requires a more rugged constitution.In contrast, a woven flower basket calls for vines of a more supple nature. These vines are often found by the water's edge, where the thirsty rattan palms send out myriad soft offshoots that cover the ground like a carpet. Such soft vines can be bent to form the shape of a basket without snapping.Once enough vines have been collected, it is time to return home and process them.The woody cores can be used to shape and weave a solid frame, while the skin, once peeled away, can be woven into a fabric-like material that helps give rattan goods their finished shape. Both of these materials must first be washed and dried.Lan Yan likes to sing while she soaks and stirs the rattan strips — and as she pulls them out of the water, one by one, to dry them in the courtyard. Sometimes her mother and father will join her, and they will talk and laugh while they lay the strips out in the sun.Once the cores and skins have been processed, then comes the most crucial part of the process — weaving.Rattan weaving requires significant concentration — warp and weft, along and across. From a pile of cores and strips of skin, a perfectly sculpted object begins to take shape.Lan Yan views the fruits of her labor not so much as products, but as living entities, lovingly birthed by her hands.Even if two of her creations might appear indistinguishable to an outside observer, she can tell them apart by the subtle changes in touch and force applied, the order of her weaving, or the emotions she felt while she made them. Each of her rattan children has its unique feel.While weaving, Lan Yan maintains a singular focus on her task. She is not easily distracted by idle chatter, nor the excited cries of her neighbors' cats and dogs, nor graceful swallows swooping beneath the eaves. There are times — perhaps to escape the noise — when she will take her work to a familiar mountainside to sit in silence and weave.Unlike her family at home, the flowers, birds, fish, and insects that roam freely in the forested hills feel no need to leave a quiet space for Lan Yan to weave in.The most mischievous offenders are the little foxes, who, indulging their natural curiosity, come to watch Lan Yan as she works, nudging and sniffing at her jugs and jars, spilling her varnish and inadvertently waterproofing their paws.The panicked foxes then trample on the flower basket she has been weaving, leaving shiny paw prints in their wake. Thanks to this unique touch — the innocence of the wilderness — this basket will become one of Lan Yan's favorite creations.That is how rattan weaving is — simple yet never boring, and this experience is one of Lan Yan's most cherished and happiest moments in a life spent devoted to her craft."

    "text": "Much like the exorcists who dwell on Mt. Tianheng, the Lan clan, with their affinity for the Qimen arts, have long made Chenyu Vale their home.One such art requires the use of rattan figures. As a result, such figures — and the skills to make them — are something the Lan clan values highly. What sets Lan Yan apart, is that unlike the rest of her family, who view rattan weaving as a means to an end, she views it as an art in itself, one whose importance far outstrips the arcane and esoteric purposes that fascinate her kin.Though Lan Yan once studied the classic texts of the Qimen arts under the tutelage of her relatives, she did little more than scratch the surface, and her knowledge pales before experienced practitioners. Then again, she does not claim to be an expert, though that doesn't stop curious members of the association from asking her to perform rituals or ward off ill omens.After receiving too many such requests, Lan Yan can only sigh.Born into a branch of the Lan clan, Lan Yan does not conform to the typical image of a geomancer that an outsider might have. The only visible sign of her heritage is her silver hair ornament, modeled after the \"Jade-Plumed Silverwing.\"This heirloom symbolizes the Lan clan's connections to the \"Eight Adepts\" — significant figures in Liyue's history.The term refers to eight great heroes who once fought against the god Tao Dou. Of these eight heroes, the Jade-Plumed Silverwing, Lone Butterfly of the Crimson Flame, and Gold-Eyed Celadon Mare are known as the Three Beasts of Tao Dou.Of the remaining five, Wind Reader, the Wuwang Kid, and the Yunlai Angler were honored as the Three Hermits of Guizang. They and the Two Sages of Lianshan were all human.The Jade-Plumed Silverwing had a deep connection with Wind Reader, who was a truly remarkable individual. It was he who first taught the Lan clan the secrets of the Qimen arts.The silver ornament that Lan Yan now wears in her hair has been passed down from generation to generation so that the descendants of the Lan clan never forget where they came from.Lan Yan knows the story of the Eight Adepts well and regularly makes trips to watch Liyue opera performances that tell of their exploits. Despite this, their story never left a strong impression on her.Throughout Liyue's long history, selfless acts for the benefit of future generations — or \"planting trees for the children of tomorrow,\" as the locals like to say — have been a recurring motif. Many such tales have already been lost to the winds of time, while others have entered the collective psyche and become part of Liyue's living folk memory.And because such stories exist, carefree, exuberant young men and women like Lan Yan are free to roam the wild slopes of Chenyu Vale, smiling and laughing and singing folk songs amidst nature's beauty."

This year, the Ministry of Civil Affairs asked specifically for Lan Yan.For Lan Yan, who grew up in the leafy confines of the vale, rarely venturing beyond its verdant slopes except to accompany her grandfather on his travels, this was her first real journey to the city.Like so many customers who have traveled to Chenyu Vale to seek the services of the famed rattan weaving master, those at the Ministry of Civil Affairs were shocked to discover that the master artisan whose help they sought was a fresh-faced, unimposing young woman.The young artisan politely rejected the food and lodging the ministry offered, preferring to wander the city streets by herself, conversing with visitors and citizens alike — to use her own words, \"This is my first time coming as far as Liyue Harbor, I'd like to find my own way around.\"She ate her first meal in the Wanmin Restaurant, where she was taken unawares by the spicy boiled fish, and was left gulping down water to cool the fires on her tongue.She then spent much of her first evening wandering Chihu Rock, before Liyue Harbor's nighttime soundscape soothed her to sleep.Her first conversation was with a soldier returning home from a posting to the Chasm. The soldier helped a lost Lan Yan find her bearings and, upon hearing she had come from Chenyu Vale, told her at length of the red mountains of the Chasm and played her a melodious tune.\"The world truly is a large place,\" she thought.Liyue itself is already home to many people and places, each unique in their own way. The waters of Chenyu Vale sport gentle beauty and natural charm, the clamorous streets of Liyue Harbor burst with bustling color, and the stark landscapes of the Chasm are vast and imposing. And outside Liyue... an even larger world awaits.For the first time in her life, Lan Yan desired to see more of the world, to use the rattan strands of her hometown to weave the scenes she might see there to become one with her own heart."

Whenever she feels sad, all she needs to do is allow a mischievous lamb to butt its head against her leg or a fluffy puppy to nip her hand, and her worries melt away like morning snow.As far as Lan Yan is concerned, every second spent thinking unhappy thoughts is time that could be better devoted to playing happily with the beasts of the fields and forests.Most of the time, an afternoon whiled away among the tea trees with her animal friends is enough to dispel unpleasant feelings.However, there are times when more drastic action is required — such as letting her cares wash away while swimming in the wilds.There isn't a pool or waterway between Qiaoying Village and Mt. Lingmeng that Lan Yan hasn't swum in, nor a crisp mountain spring that hasn't filled her cupped hands or reflected her face.She reclines in the water, the gentle current keeping her afloat, as her black hair swirls on the surface and tiny fish nibble playfully at her feet. All the while, warm rays of sunlight cast dappled shadows on the streambed below.Here she daydreams in viridian and emerald hues of a life much the same as hers.She wakes at dawn in such dreams, in a house with white brick walls and a gray tiled roof. There she drinks a cup of morning tea, before punting a bamboo raft down the stream outside, singing all the while. In her dream, too, she weaves rattan objects, as a tiny dog bounds over to her side and licks her hand. And with that, she awakens.Like every son and daughter of Chenyu Vale, Lan Yan is as simple and pure as a clear mountain spring.She has everything she wants and so doesn't dwell on dreams.The bright lights and exotic sights of the world outside are no more attractive to her than a butterfly to a deer. Sure, a curious deer may leave its verdant slopes to gaze upon a passing butterfly, but it will soon return to whence it came to happily graze once more.Wherever Lan Yan's travels may take her, it is never long before she returns home to Chenyu Vale.Even the most wonderful dreams cannot compare to the scent of freshly roasted tea leaves, just as even the most distant fantasies cannot compete with the beauty of the swirling mountain mists that wreath Mt. Xuanlian.After wringing out her hair by the water's edge and getting back into her dry clothes, Lan Yan carefully dons each of her silver bracelets, earrings, and necklace. It is time for her to return home.The silver ornamentations that adorn her are gifts from her family, and they chime and jingle as she walks, playing a melodious mountain tune. Wherever she goes, she is accompanied by joyful music.Swimming in the wilds is not without its dangers, and she has been reprimanded by her grandfather on more than one occasion. There would surely be more stern words if she were to be caught again today. Next time, she muses, it might be better to take a friend.But that's a matter for another day. Tonight, there is Tea-Smoked Squab on the menu."

To hear her tell it, her grandfather also claimed that swallows could bring about an early demise if treated unkindly.It's easy to get on board with the message preaching kindness and the sanctity of life, but the part about dying if you're not quite nice enough seems a little extreme.Many such old superstitions are as unfathomable to people today as rain that falls from a cloudless sky — ideas such as \"fingernails shouldn't be cut at night,\" \"chopsticks mustn't be laid horizontally on bowls,\" or \"a new season's first picking of tea cannot be drunk by children.\"In truth, even though kindness to swallows is a widely practiced folk tradition in Chenyu Vale, to most youths, the idea is nothing more than a nursery rhyme, sung to them as infants.Only the Lan family upholds this tradition with the rigor of an unwritten rule — any swallow that builds its nest beneath their eaves is welcome to stay for as long as it may please.\"They can be bothersome at times, but once the swallows get to know me, they like to hop up on my shoulder and keep me company while I weave.\"When she told you this, you were with her in Jademouth, riding Uncle Bosu's bamboo raft. The old man's singing was accompanied by a gentle breeze, while a pelican lay fast asleep in the back of the boat.The silver swallow in her hair glinted brightly in the sunlight, as warm and lustrous as her eyes.Gazing at that ornament, you couldn't help but wonder if the Lan family's tradition of caring for swallows might stem from their history with the Jade-Plumed Silverwing, and your thoughts turned to the stories of those ancient days.Seeing the glazed expression in your eyes, Lan Yan leaned in and gently tweaked your nose.As though waking from a dream, you were greeted by her smiling face, and not far in the distance, the sights and sounds of the docks told you that your journey was almost at an end."

    "text": "Much like all handicrafts, rattan weaving is a skill that relies more on the body than the mind.Once a frame has been crafted and the overall shape of an object set, Lan Yan must use the utmost care to weave each warp and every weft. After years of practice, the skills and movements of her craft have not only been burned into her brain but become second nature and muscle memory.On a deeper level, this process has also gradually refined and clarified her spirit.Lan Yan is a master rattan weaver. She has never been given over to grandiose dreams of chasing the moon and the stars, nor of forsaking all that she has and living her life as a hermit on some distant mountain.Her life is a simple one, natural and unadorned.As she weaves, her hands honor the memories of days past, retracing their steps to expertly craft delicate patterns and shapes.All the while, her heart does not lie idle, for she is thinking of the mountain mists, the vines that climb the cliffs and crags, and the sensation of freshly fallen leaves beneath her bare and carefree feet.She thinks of Chenyu Vale — of her family amidst the mountains and rivers — and the rattan in her hands becomes supple and pliable to her will.She dreams of weaving these beautiful things with her own two hands so that her memories can live forever in the objects she creates. Perhaps because her heart is filled with warmth and kindness, the objects that Lan Yan crafts exude a simple, gentle spirit.Perhaps that's also why the cats, dogs, birds, and squirrels of Chenyu Vale are never scared to approach her.\"Even the adepti come to watch Lan Yan weave.\" Her grandfather had once proudly claimed.No one could know for sure if the adepti had ever truly stopped in passing to watch Lan Yan perform her craft. Lan Yan herself believes that beings who would pour their power into protecting the waters and mountains of the vale, and all those who dwelt there, would surely have an appreciation for handicrafts so lovingly created and imbued with the spirit of their creator.So when she discovered a Vision glinting softly at the bottom of her rattan basket, she was not surprised. She simply picked it up and continued on her way, gathering rattan vines."

I... don't mind...\"At last, his tightly-wound emotions came loose, allowing his many injuries to rob him of his consciousness, and he collapsed.When he reawakened, he found that his wounds had been cauterized by a mysterious flame, stopping both the bleeding and the pain.A jewel pulsed warmly in the palm of his hand, its rhythm in time with the heartbeat in his chest — the beating heart of an adventurer.This was not the mercy of the world, or that fate took pity on him. Rather, this was his \"final reward,\" one befitting a person with Bennett's burning passion."

If some uninformed passerby were to stumble in at this precise moment, they would surely mistake the scene before them for that of an ordinary, happy family.\nBut just as Arlecchino raised her steaming cup to take a sip of scalding-hot black tea, the clock began to chime — and within an instant, the laughter and cheer that filled the room were banished. The flames flickered so that for a moment the light faltered, the faces of all present cast in somber expression.\nPlacing her cup back down, Arlecchino stood up, and in a calm, measured tone, called out several names:\n\"Chapleau, you're with Lyney. Retrieve the required intelligence. Foltz, you and Filliol are on guard duty. Stay back and tend to the Hearth...\"\n\"Yes, 'Father.'\"\nWithout a redundant syllable, nor a hint of hesitation, they answered as one.\nNot long after, the fire had dwindled and the house fallen utterly silent, with nothing to be seen but a single shaft of infiltrating moonlight, peeking through a gap in the curtains upon a cup of gradually cooling tea."

He remembered that long ago, an alpaca named Little Pinecone had bumped into that same tree, which might explain why Ororon referred to it as Big Pinecone.\n\"And it's not even a pine tree,\" thought Ifa, though he didn't inquire further.\nA weird and wonderful land indeed. It is a nation that embraces all living beings, whether their paths in life have been smooth, or not so smooth.

From a distance, it appears much like a cloud of faintly glowing purple mist in the mountain valleys.\nThe impression left by members of their tribe on others is similar — profound, mysterious, and with a penchant for cryptic turns of phrase. Unless they're out traveling on a commission, such as for healing or fortune-telling, they seldom show themselves outside.<!--\n              -->Ororon, however, is an exception. This is not due to an inclination for mingling with the crowds, but rather that he prefers exploring the wilderness. He ventures deeper and deeper in directions where few dare to tread, and even ten Tatankasaurs could not drag him back.<!--\n              -->What's more, \"where few dare to tread\" is not simply limited to a literal sense. All who have spoken with him know that keeping up with his train of thought can be... a challenge, to say the least. A test, if you will, of both wits and perseverance.<!--\n              -->Yet it has never been Ororon's intention to pose such a challenge, just as the reasons behind many of his words and actions are actually quite simple and not in need of overinterpretation.<!--\n              -->Take, for instance, the time a kind-hearted passerby came across his dwelling in the wild. Wearing a concerned expression, they approached and asked, \"I see you're living all alone out here... Must have fallen out with someone in your tribe, huh? Is there anything I can help you out with?\"<!--\n              -->\"Of course not.\"<!--\n              -->Ororon paused from his gardening for a moment, then stood up and gestured at the Aphids all around him, before responding earnestly, \"It's just that these little guys love this place, and I'm more than happy to keep them company.\""

    "text": "Due to the existence of Ancient Names, the people of Natlan place great importance on names in general. Influenced by the environment he grew up in, Ororon developed a habit of naming everything around him — whether they were capable of breathing or not.<!--\n              -->Some names would accompany the things they signified for their entire lives. Though a day will come when a flower wilts and a cup breaks, their names are there for however long or short their existence may be. Even if they only last a minute, their purpose will have been served, their worth fulfilled.<!--\n              -->Other names, however, would change along the way. It was not that Ororon's feelings themselves had changed; but rather that the name's \"owner\" had undergone some kind of experiential transformation, thus naturally requiring a new, more suitable name. For instance, if a Saurian grew more and more rotund over time, you could hardly keep calling him something like \"Wafer-Thin,\" could you?<!--\n              -->Having said that, he does not tend to dwell too much on the meanings that the names themselves contain. Firstly, because the names he gives are always straightforward, their meanings clear at a glance. But secondly, because he comes up with them merely for ease of reference, without any deeper intent; in other words, they were not made to carry a special emotion. To him, all names are precious, all neutral, all equal as tools to facilitate communication.<!--\n              -->He sees his own name in the same way; the only difference being that he doesn't actually know what it means.<!--\n              -->The name Ororon was written on the inside of the cloth he was found swaddled within. He has searched for references in old books, even asked some elders, but has never seen mention nor met any who know of such a name, let alone its meaning.<!--\n              -->Was it simply his Granny's age, or the fact that the writing on the cloth was so unclear, or even a combination of the two that caused her to misread it?<!--\n              -->This, though, was something he would have to ponder by himself — were he to ask it out loud, he would no doubt receive a sharp flick on the forehead from Granny in return."

    "text": "The people of the Masters of the Night-Wind like to use woven scrolls to record all kinds of stories, legends, and histories. Patterns of thread woven into fabric cannot hope to match the detail of simple, straightforward written records, tending instead towards abstraction and conceptual shapes often imbued with the weaver's emotions and feelings.<!--\n              -->In other words, subjective re-creation is a huge part of the process. What should be rendered as the main subject, what as the background, what emphasized, and what simplified — all of this demands the weaver's consideration and hangs upon their creativity.<!--\n              -->In principle, it may sound simple enough, but it had Ororon stumped.<!--\n              -->First of all, he did not like being forced to differentiate between primary and secondary elements. As he saw it, all the elements were of equal importance — so whether it was the characters and their backgrounds, or the buildings and their scenic backdrops, they all deserved to be allotted equal amounts of weaving materials. Even the dew drops on a Saurian Claw Succulent in the ground deserved to be depicted, as did the wrinkles on the tribal elders' faces, vividly standing out upon the fabric.<!--\n              -->This led to problem number two: his patience when it came to weaving was, to be quite frank, limited. In order to be fair, whether it was a big tree outside a door or the shadows of the people beneath it, the linework had to have the same number of layers, the same level of detail. The consequence of doing so was that everything on the fabric became simplified to a certain level, so that what he ended up producing could barely be called a woven scroll; it was more like a patterned towel.<!--\n              -->Some things are just hard to teach, pure and simple — and especially in artistic fields that depend more heavily upon natural talent. Since the child himself had already shown extraordinary talent in other areas, such as his awareness of spirits and intuition when it came to surveying the ley lines, the master artisans of the tribe gave up on trying to force Ororon to perfect this craft. Instead, they allowed him to treat it simply as an extracurricular hobby, letting him pursue it however he so desired.<!--\n              -->Ororon took full advantage of this, adept as he was at pushing boundaries. Later on, in fact, he stopped using fabric and yarn altogether, preferring to use pen and paper to sketch out his ideas as quickly and efficiently as possible. After all, if you could capture the essence of something with a few strokes, why go through the slow, laborious process of weaving it all out? Besides, the people of the Masters of the Night-Wind are known to have a knack for graffiti, so when those from other tribes saw Ororon's drawings, they would gaze at them in awe, thinking them to be some sort of ancient glyphs imbued with mysterious blessings.<!--\n              -->In reality, Ororon hardly ever drew anything that proved to be particularly useful. His most meaningful and carefully drawn work is the placard in front of Ifa's clinic. The lines are smooth, the colors bright, and—<!--\n              -->\"Since the poor Saurian had his wings wrapped in bandages, I put more thought into that part of the drawing. Though it doesn't take up much of the whole, I used the same amount of ink on him as I did when drawing you.\"<!--\n              -->\"Sweet,\" said Ifa, and seeing the sincerity in Ororon's eyes, felt a great sense of calm. \"Never seen the real me depicted so accurately before. Really appreciate it, my dear bro.\""

    "text": "Those who are kind to others will themselves be treated kindly. It is precisely his love for the countless beings of the natural world that has earned Ororon the kindness of the people and creatures of this land.<!--\n              -->...Ha! Yeah right. That's just not how things work in reality. Sure, most people were kind to Ororon, but this did not necessarily have anything to do with his love of nature.<!--\n              -->One reason was sympathy — he was a foundling, abandoned in the mountains, with no relatives to take care of him, and it would have been quite impossible for him to have survived on his own. Lending a helping hand by providing a bit of food or clothing was not particularly hard, while the satisfaction of seeing a child grow up healthy and strong far outweighed any such effort. So why wouldn't they?<!--\n              -->Another was simply that they liked him. Ororon was very well-behaved (most of the time), honest (generally speaking), quiet, sensible, and he always studied hard. He never showed any inclination for mischief, such as climbing up onto rooftops and tearing up tiles. He even learned how to grow crops and raise Aphids all by himself, and from that point on, was able to support himself. As a young man who did not (often) cause much of a bother to those around him, he was certainly very likeable.<!--\n              -->And the last, albeit least prevalent reason, was guilt. Due to having been born with a fragmented soul, when Ororon was first found by the tribe, they attempted to use his unusual condition to test a method for restoring Natlan's Ley Lines. Whether fortunately or not, this method of individual sacrifice did not succeed. Though this may have averted an ethical dilemma that could not be resolved, it left some of the elders with an unspoken sense of guilt.<!--\n              -->Of course, once he had grown up, Ororon came to learn of what had happened — there was no point in trying to hide it, and doing so would only have created unnecessary issues. Yet he felt no resentment about the whole affair; on the contrary, he was greatly satisfied to find out, for no matter how difficult reality was, he preferred it to living a lie.<!--\n              -->He is fully aware of the various reasons why people look out for him. Whether out of sympathy, affection, guilt, or some combination of all three, he's willing to accept it all for what it is.<!--\n              -->As Ifa would say, social relationships among people are exceedingly complex. Instead of spending time and effort trying to understand their motivations, it's better to focus on their conclusions and actions, and doing so helps avoid a great deal of mental stress. Thus, seeing as people show him such care and affection, he repays them with kindness in return. Yes, it really is that simple.<!--\n              -->\"Good thing I'm a vet,\" Ifa said, gesticulating. \"If I were a doctor who had to treat people, my job would be a lot more complicated...\"<!--\n              -->Ifa went on, seemingly listing off a whole array of strange medical cases, but Ororon's mind soon drifted off. No matter how strange they were, could they really have been stranger than his own?<!--\n              -->Come to think of... In some sense, I'm a patient too, and one beyond all hope of a cure, Ororon mused. Going a step further, he thought, if one were to focus on his ears — which looked different from the average person's — then surely he too might be considered an ailing animal? Hmm... but then again, perhaps humans too should be considered animals?<!--\n              -->At this point in his musings, Ororon interrupted Ifa's endless rambling to ask, \"If I were sick, should I come to a vet?\"<!--\n              -->Ifa stopped mid-sentence and stared back at him for a long moment.<!--\n              -->\"...You weren't listening to a single thing I said this entire time, were you?\"<!--\n              -->\"You can't just avoid questions you don't want to answer by turning them back on me,\" came Ororon's reply."

Soon after, he found himself reading through works of non-fiction, and even fantasy novels; and before long, the books were piled up high like a mountain of Cacahuatl. Ororon had essentially become a volunteer librarian, utterly submerged in a sea of knowledge that had absolutely nothing to do with him.<!--\n              -->\"I'm not that curious...\" Ororon thought to himself, beginning to feel a bit weary. But then again, he didn't really have anything else to do. And it wasn't as if the long hours of reading had been entirely fruitless.<!--\n              -->The most reasonable explanation he had come across so far came, to his surprise, in a tattered storybook about mystical creatures. It was written that, during the Archon War of the distant past, some Archons had experimented with merging the bloodlines of beasts and humans. Their goal, hoping to gain the upper hand, was to create warriors with powers that surpassed those of ordinary mortals. Most of these attempts failed, but a few flawed remnants survived, even persisting to the present day.<!--\n              -->\"Sounds plausible enough,\" Ororon mused to himself. \"But it's just a storybook...\"<!--\n              -->\"...And yet, even if it's just a storybook, it certainly sounds plausible enough.\"<!--\n              -->From a practical standpoint, he knew that with his twenty-something-year-old mind alone, he'd never uncover the truth, no matter how hard he thought. Sometimes, you just have to accept your own limitations and ignorance — or else make up a story to amuse yourself.<!--\n              -->In the end, Ororon reached the point where he simply could not bear to read another word. He took a few minutes to come up with the simplest justification that he could muster, then said to himself:<!--\n              -->It's like a puzzle game. When you try to force pieces together that don't match, there's bound to be distortion, friction, even breakage. And one day, over twenty years past, he was that broken puzzle piece, the one who had experienced the misfortune of being dropped onto the cold, hard stone."

The soldiers themselves did not hold back — it was clear they were already aware that he was working with their commander. The things they talked about were of no particular importance, yet they spoke and laughed freely, showing no restraint on account of his presence. After asking his age, one soldier even handed him a cup of a colorless drink they called \"Fire-Water.\"<!--\n              -->After a cautious sip, he proceeded to down it in one gulp, just as he had seen the soldiers do, receiving a loud cheer in response. For some reason, he felt a lot better after doing this.<!--\n              -->The soldiers around him chatted about trivial matters, every now and then breaking into songs they all knew. Ororon did not have much to add, so he simply sat there, either watching the fire before them or the sky high above. It felt so far from the ground, the individual stars like tiny white kernels, together like mist. \"Astral Mist,\" he suddenly thought to himself. Not a bad name...<!--\n              -->Later, he would learn that not all Fatui soldiers were like this. The ones he met were elite soldiers led by the First Harbinger, older veterans with experience and firm moral standards. Beyond this company, however, there were many others who were younger than he was, others whose actions would leave his brows well and truly furrowed.<!--\n              -->But on that windless night, with the stars so clearly visible in the sky, he had not yet been troubled by such knowledge. He simply let go of his worries, enjoying the friendly company and the cup of strange-tasting liquor he had been given.<!--\n              -->There would never be another night like this. He sensed it then — just like how, when he considered accepting a second drink, he was firmly stopped by The Captain. Though he seemed completely normal after the first cup and potentially could really hold his liquor, yet all the same, some places are best not delved into too deeply.<!--\n              -->But clearly, Ororon was not exactly the obedient type.

They've been sorted into different compartments based on the preferences of different animals.<!--\n              -->Most animals are actually pretty smart, and based on Ororon's observations, the gap between them and humans isn't nearly as vast as many people might think. Many humans live successful lives simply because they have inherited the knowledge of previous generations — so in a sense, the intelligence shown by animals that find ways to survive in hostile environments might actually be even more impressive.<!--\n              -->Seeking human help is also a shortcut that animals have learned while living together with humans. Sometimes, Ororon might just be walking along minding his own business when he'll suddenly feel something heavy land on his back. Should he react too slowly, he'll later discover a few extra flying squirrel claw marks in his cloak.<!--\n              -->Likewise, Ororon is convinced that animals must have some fixed way of communicating amongst themselves. Animal messengers might even be far more skilled than their human counterparts, for not only must they travel by land and air, they must also be able to speak many different languages and dialects to communicate with other species. Just the thought that the languages of Natlan's various animals might all include a phrase such as \"Ororon has treats in his pocket!\" made him smile.<!--\n              -->Even if he had ways of turning away these freeloading guests, dead set on mooching free meals, he would never actually use them.

He always acted as though whatever he was given was \"his rightful due!\", yet at the same time, seemed unable to go without human company. Ororon would generally ignore the things he said, dangling food in front of him and watching Ajaw's eyes follow its motion from behind his sunglasses (...That pair of shiny dots must be his eyes? Right?).

Water droplets fell from above, landing on his outstretched hand. They were sticky to the touch.<!--\n              -->There was moisture, and within it, nutrients. He nodded to himself; this place could probably birth life.<!--\n              -->It was at this moment that he awoke. It did not feel like a good dream, yet neither was it a nightmare. He'd felt cold in the dream. It was pretty cool, so could it simply be the nighttime chill? \"I should prepare a thicker blanket for tomorrow,\" he thought.<!--\n              -->On the second night, he dreamt of a scorching wind.<!--\n              -->All he could see were pale stone pillars and clouds trimmed with crimson linings.

Just one step forward and he would reach it... Just one more step...<!--\n              -->He awoke with a start. People naturally gravitate toward warmth, and he himself had always loved the fires of Natlan, but the sheer heat of that dream filled him with dread. Not a good call, he thought, shaking his head; unsure if he was rejecting the dream or reality itself. It seemed that the Alpaca wool blanket might have been a bit too much, given the current season.<!--\n              -->On the third and final night, he dreamt of a pitch-black universe and a labyrinth of mirrors. He stared at the overlapping surfaces that encircled him, upon which countless other Ororons stared back.<!--\n              -->He heard an imaginary voice say, \"If your shadow reflects itself enough times, maybe you can piece together your entire self!\" There was no kindness in that voice, yet nor was there malice either — simply the teasing tone of a detached observer.<!--\n              -->But how could a reflection reveal something that was not there in the first place?

This time, he did not even try to explain the cause of his dream; the temperature and his blanket were simply excuses that he had now exhausted. Even after fully waking, he could still feel a lingering anger, along with an unusual heaviness weighing him down.<!--\n              -->Yet the things he wore and carried on his person could not have been lighter.

Wealth has never been his pursuit, and regardless of summer or winter, what he seeks has always been true peace in his heart. Despite the wilderness being his home, he never worries about the impending rain or storm. It is as if rainstorms are afraid of him, because they do not dare to cross his path.\nOut of curiosity, someone asked about this talent and Kazuha answered with absolute honesty &mdash; reading the sounds of nature is a unique ability of his. People do not usually pay attention to the weather, so it is no surprise that they are unable to discover the signs it reveals. However, given Kazuha's skill, he can sense the arrival of snow and rain immediately with just a gust of wind or abnormal humidity. That is when he knows it's time to seek shelter.\nKazuha, who has traversed around the lands, has avoided countless torrents of storms and flashes of lightning. This time, however, what awaits him will be an unprecedented thunderstorm. This time, he will no longer seek refuge. He, the rain, and the lightning will meet at the intersection of fate, as destiny marks it.\n\"&mdash;&mdash; I hear a storm strike far and distant, with only a whisper light and faint.

Take care of him, now.\"The sailors trusted Beidou's judgment and admired the newcomer for his martial prowess, not to mention his ability to predict the weather, so they were happy to overlook his reticence to discuss his past, and welcomed him aboard.Still, their curiosity did not abate, and they would often find all sorts of excuses to try and ply him for information about his experiences.\"I've heard that they make some sweet blades there in Inazuma and that the bigger the fish you are, the swankier the sword. So, uh... how's yours measure up?\"\"...\"Kazuha would remain silent in the face of all such queries.Over time, after countless attempts to garner a response proved futile, the sailors would simply give up asking.Eventually, it was an off-the-cuff remark from Chief Mate, Juza, just a few days later that finally managed to elicit a reply.\"Hey, Inazuma boy. What are the lads supposed to call you if they don't even know your name?\"The young sailor wiped the sweat from his brow with his callused hands.\"My name is Kaedehara Kazuha, a wandering samurai.

He hails from an Inazuman noble house of old, the last son of the Kaedehara Clan.Inazuma City is home to many illustrious clans, and the Kaedehara name was once one of the most renowned among them. But fortune is fickle, and the Kaedeharas' fortunes had already collapsed by the time they were Kazuha's to inherit.As the young master of the house, Kazuha could do nothing but watch as his family's future crumbled around him. But as helpless as this made him feel, when the moment came that the home was officially repossessed and the last attendant was finally dismissed, he breathed a sigh of relief: As far as he was concerned, this was a golden opportunity to begin leading a free and wandering life.He had always longed to roam the mountains and forests, and had held a deep admiration for the beauty and authenticity of nature since his youth.To Kazuha, nature had never been silent. It had always spoken to him, conveying its feelings in its own unique language.When the wind ceases to speak and the world falls silent, that is the calm before the skies begin to weep. When silent springs suddenly leap into activity, it is the omen of a great earthquake.These are the unique poetics that nature has bestowed upon him, and Kazuha was never one to be preoccupied with luxury anyway — so if the burden of family responsibility should drop from his shoulders, why not go wandering, and travel light?Thus did Kazuha strike out on his journey, like a falling leaf in the yard carried away by the wind."

    "text": "All travelers who outdoors roam need some skill to call their own. For Kazuha, this is his ability to read the sounds of nature.After leaving Inazuma City, Kazuha wandered here and there. Things were different now: all of nature was his treasured home, and the sounds of wind and water beneath the sight of drifting clouds set his heart at ease.All that he saw on the road filled him with curiosity. It was in this state of mind that Kazuha arrived at a mountain in the south.It was early summer, and the frequent and heavy rainfall had turned the mountain roads to mud. Seeing that night was soon to fall, Kazuha decided to find somewhere to shelter from the rain. No sooner had he had this thought than he turned around to see a small straw hut at the far end of the road.The traveling merchant with whom he was traveling at that time whooped for joy at the sight of the hut: \"Kazuha, look! We'll have a roof over our heads tonight!\"But Kazuha did not speak. He paused and listened intently for a long while before he finally replied: \"If you were to ask my opinion... it may be best to stay away.\"But the merchant did not wish to remain in the rain. He left Kazuha and made his way to the house.Upon knocking at the door, the traveling merchant was met by a lovely woman who offered him shelter, tea, food, and even bedding for the night.Perhaps it was the excellent food, but the merchant quickly became drowsy and fell asleep immediately after finishing his meal.When he awoke the following morning, there was no roof over his head. The bright sunlight pierced his eyes, and all he could see was Kazuha standing nearby, looking down at him and smiling.Before the merchant could speak, he vomited a great pile of leaves and mud. And as for the bedding upon which he had slept so soundly, ah, it too was mud.Kazuha smiled and said: \"The wind is weaker where there are houses. Yet here stood a hut, and there was no change in the mountain breeze. I think you might have been the victim of a bake-danuki's prank. Never mind. Next time, listen more closely to the wind and tread with care.\""

Or so Kazuha thought.But something happened soon thereafter that would shatter his calm disposition — the Almighty Shogun promulgated the Vision Hunt Decree and swore to retrieve all Visions.All who wielded them, including Kazuha, were stricken with panic, concealing their identities and going into hiding.It was then that Kazuha received shocking news: Someone had dared to call for a \"duel before the throne,\" and that someone was none other than Kazuha's dear friend.The defeated party in a duel before the throne would face punishment at the hand of the Shogun herself. His friend was prepared to risk all to come before the throne, partly for the chance to fight against a strong foe, but also to demonstrate the meaning of courage to all.And yet, to call for this challenge now, of all times... Kazuha feared that his punishment, should he fail, would be absolute: The Almighty Shogun would unleash her lightning upon him in its full fury, and it would surely take his life.Even the normally calm Kazuha could not restrain himself. He drew his sword and stormed into Tenshukaku like a whirlwind... But alas, he arrived too late.His friend's sword lay shattered in pieces, his Vision now an empty husk. Now a wanted man himself, Kazuha fled with grief in his heart.From that moment on, the days of peaceful wanderings were over, and Kazuha's life became an unending series of battles.Kazuha did not fear battle, of course, but the constant fighting left him feeling lost and perplexed.He did not regret having set out on his doomed rescue mission, nor did he begrudge his friend for leaving him, but he could not help but think...\"Is this endless conflict truly the only way to assert one's ideals?\""

It was almost as if his late friend were lending him his aid from behind the scenes.This empty shell of a Vision not only proved this, but had also brought him many fateful encounters along the way:He had been aided by the resistance, saved and taken in by Captain Beidou, and he had even met the fabled Traveler...In life there were seasons of hopelessness and desperation, but there were also moments of great serendipity.His journey was like the rise and fall of a mountain path — at times, the struggle was all but too much to bear, but there would always be moments when he would touch the clouds."

Not a single feather flapped, and not a single cicada sang.Even the roiling waves seemed to have fallen into slumber, leaving just the faint whisper of the wind audible against the silence. Kazuha stuck out his tongue — the air tasted heavy and gloomy.This told him that it would soon rain.He peered into the distance and spotted a plume of smoke up ahead. Below it were several straw huts. Tonight, it seemed, he would have a roof over his head.He informed the owner of the house that a storm was coming. At first, he was met with skepticism, but come noon the rains arrived right on cue.In awe of this wanderer's skill, the master of the house eagerly offered him lodging.The storm raged into the night. Kazuha held his quilt close, and as he listened to the onslaught of rain against the autumn leaves, his mind began to wander.In the time since the Kaedehara Clan's fortune had faded away and he had set off on his journey, Kazuha had traveled across many of Inazuma's islands and had become intimately acquainted with the plight of the wanderer.Moving between islands usually necessitated traveling by sea. Kazuha would make these trips alone, in a small, slow boat, making things all the more perilous when he had to battle against strong headwinds or violent thunderstorms...And yet, there was limitless fascination to be found in this same journey of his, where the vast sky and boundless earth was his home, and all living things that inhabited them were his friends.If one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty.But if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure.With his sword in his hand and his chosen path in his heart, he could go on his way with a song on his lips and with nothing to fear, no matter the perils he may face.Kazuha slept soundly that night, his mind at rest having made peace with his feelings.The next day, he awoke to the sound of birds... and a shining Vision lying upon his chest."

Child custody disputes are the absolute worst, as no matter how she settles them, the settlement will have a great psychological impact on the innocent children.

Then why the use of \"didn't expect\"? One could only postulate that the Traveler had some expectation of where she might appear, and that her current location was not such a place.

For convenience, Yanfei tends to use Mora to balance the scales, which is to say that she uses Mora to evaluate objects.The prices of many objects have slowly changed over the years, but weighing an object with this balance only gives its value at the time Mora was created, leaving the rest to Yanfei to exercise her own wisdom and judgment.Across the measurements of countless objects, Yanfei is able to see the changes in Liyue. Some objects that were once common have become vanishingly rare, and some exotic objects of the past have been rendered pedestrian today.This steelyard balance reminds her that many things cannot be valued by the standards of the world.Yanfei once tried to weigh the value of a Vision, but no matter how much Mora she added, the scales would not be balanced.In frustration, she placed on the scale the box at her waist, which contained her heavy, handwritten legal notations.

In the far future, the law will have entered into the people's hearts. All people will be amiable, modest, and live happily in this world. The halls of judgment will lie empty and the mountains of legalese shall be caked in years of dust.Though this may sound like something very far off, for someone like Yanfei, in whom flows the blood of an illuminated beast, living till that day is hardly a great accomplishment.\"Hmm, but if I think about it more deeply, I'd be out of a job then, wouldn't I?\"After encountering one of Xinyan's performances by chance, Yanfei was quite taken by this new wave of performance art.That said, learning an instrument from scratch proved to be a bit difficult, so after consulting a great many resources, Yanfei came to what she considered to be a decent backup plan.If such a day were to arrive, she would just become a rapper.For someone who can recite tens of thousands of words' worth of Liyue law from front to back within an hour, speed at least should be no challenge."

This principle is also the reason why she has never been convicted of exploiting any such loopholes.Yanfei believes in \"no structure without laws,\" and what she wishes for is to \"live as one pleases without overstepping.\"Everyone in Liyue, adeptus or mortal, protects it in their own way.That is why Yanfei possesses a Vision, one that is of equal weight to her principles."

Her fruits are always intoxicatingly sweet, and her vegetables smack of rich, crisp petrichor &mdash; the taste of freshly rained-upon grassland bathed in sunlight. Over time, people have started erupting in heartsome laughter whenever they espy Varesa from afar, knowing a wonderful feast to be close at hand...\nIn the children's legends, a certain \"Masked Hero\" shall descend whenever evil beings and monsters run amok, wreathed in lightning. Charging at her foes with three times the ferocity of a Tatankasaurus, she delivers kicks as explosive as pyroclastic fallout, sending all the bad guys flying! The hero's battle cry when she executes her finishing move has become a popular catchphrase among the children, and the incredible swiftness of her departure is seen as the benchmark for \"heroic speed\"...\nAstute observers would discover that the areas where the \"Masked Hero\" metes out justice overlap neatly with the Collective of Plenty's trade routes.\nAs was their duty, the Patrol Team approached their colleague, Varesa, asking if she had encountered such an individual, to which Varesa responded while scratching her head in bewilderment:\n\"Umm... That sounds a lot like me, though?\"\nAt the unanimous nods of her team members, Varesa, who only just realized what they meant, suddenly felt shy. She vigorously shook her head, saying:\n\"I'll try harder next time &mdash; send the bad guys packing before anyone can even see them! But for now... I'm going to get something to eat first!\""

    "text": "\"Time for training, Varesa!\"Every morning the coach would bellow her thunderous words, so loud in fact that a cloud of dust would rise up from the orchard.A few moments later, a core member of the Collective of Plenty's Patrol Team and the manager of a popular orchard — Varesa, who had overslept — would clumsily bumble her way into the gym, a slice of jam-coated bread in her mouth.At this point, Varesa would listen to her coach's instructions with sleep-heavy eyes and a blank expression, before dutifully starting her warmups and slowly regaining her strength...Occasionally, her coach would point out — that jam contains too much sugar, which means it's punishment time! Only then would Varesa realize that, in her groggy haste, she'd picked her favorite condiment rather than the healthiest one.Faced with her coach's wrath, all a gloomy-looking Varesa could do was shuffle over to the most absurdly heavy barbell rack, all the while under the reverent, admiring, and dumbstruck gazes of her peers. That sort of weight would strain the physical limits of any normal human, leaving them with half a month of aches... Yet there Varesa was, performing some simple stretches, preparing to take on what even elite warriors would consider a \"lethal weight.\"But in the midst of such seemingly inhuman training, Varesa would instead grow more energetic — and as the light returned to her eyes, she would begin to smile.So it is that in the Collective of Plenty, whose people constantly pursue the pinnacle of strength, even its toughest warriors dare not challenge Varesa.But if one wishes to investigate the source of Varesa's strength, they will soon find... that she lives a life far too laid back.Together with her saurian companion Vanana, she manages her orchard, steadily works her fields, then sets up her stall to sell her harvest, which she does without a hint of hurry... Hearing about her daily routine is enough to put one to sleep, for there is nothing mysterious about it at all.No matter how you look at it, isn't her life just as ordinary as any of her neighbors'?In almost all respects, it might well be — but with the exception of her diet.One more helping, please! And another, with more seasoning this time! Oh, and another, please — the bigger the better!It's standard fare for Varesa to effortlessly inhale enough food to feed thirty, forty, even fifty people. Even an eating competition like the \"Epic Feast Showdown\" has to open a separate venue, especially for her...Witnessing such marvels, people can't help but wonder...\"Could it be that for a prodigy like her, the more she eats, the stronger she gets?\""

    "text": "For Varesa, every day is a happy day.Her parents often say, \"The Tollan Volcano didn't erupt for ages and ages before or after the birth of our daughter.\"But Varesa is no divinity, and her arrival could not have quelled the volcano's fury. \"For ages and ages\" was simply a figure of speech.Yet the fact that she was born in a time unafflicted by natural disaster was itself proof enough of her luck.In the prosperous Collective of Plenty, Varesa's family has always lived in contentment. Having never experienced a lack of material comforts, she grew up warm and well-fed. Her parents harbored no lofty expectations for her, only wishing for their daughter to be happy, healthy, and to take over the orchard once she was ready.So as her father tended the orchard, Varesa's mother would place her on the back of the little saurian, Vanana, and follow along. If her father dropped any fruit, Varesa would be quick to catch them, earning her the praise of her parents and affectionate nuzzles from Vanana.When they used to set up their stall to sell fruits, Varesa's mother would hold her, sit beside her father, open up a woven scroll, and read her stories. From cozy saurian fairytales to legends of mighty heroes, she combined lighthearted episodes with action-packed sequences with masterful pacing. Varesa, snacking away as she listened along, was utterly engrossed. Sometimes, she would eat an entire crate of Quenepa Berries without even realizing, much to her father's exasperated mirth.Such a laid-back childhood bestowed upon Varesa a personality both gentle and generous.In the Collective of Plenty, strength is the calling card of the people. The tall and strong garner adoration and respect, and that goes right the way from childhood.Despite her unremarkable physique, it wasn't long before little Varesa had managed to lift and toss the children's former leader, along with his prized youth barbell, high into the air.\"Former,\" because from that moment on, the children unanimously decided that Varesa should be their new leader. However, being a traditional leader figure did not interest her.Instead, Varesa had set her sights on becoming a hero — someone who, at the same time as maintaining order, let everyone eat and play to their heart's content too!If I've got anything scrumptious at home, I'll share it with everyone! And if I've bought something fun, we can all play together!Stop bullying him, or I'll carry you away! You there, hogging the comics and the toys — share them with the others, or I'll drag you off myself!And all you trouble makers — you're getting a knuckle sandwich if you don't knock it off...Ah, no, no... If I punch them, they'll be unconscious for weeks... I'll just give them a light tap on the head instead.Anyway, everyone should play nice and get along! No squabbling, you hear me? And definitely no being selfish or deliberately causing trouble for others!It was around this time that Varesa first displayed her full potential, perhaps to a slightly extreme degree...Her frail friend told her of a wild fruit tree north of the tribe, its fruits miraculously sweet and tangy.Hearing that, the little Varesa uprooted the entire tree and brought it to her friend's doorstep.Her mother saw this as a chance to teach her a lesson — not just that she shouldn't hurt fruit trees, but also the importance of living in harmony with nature. Together, the two of them carefully replanted the tree in its original spot...Another time, the chief said that there had been more rockfalls than usual near the tribe, warning everyone to be careful.Hearing this, the little Varesa found somewhere high to stand. Hands on hips, she looked out for these rocks. When she saw one, she'd jump in, and give it a mighty kick to send it off course!Her father then took Varesa to even higher ground to look for the source of the falling rocks. They dug holes, filled craters with mud, and made sure all the boulders would stay put so it wouldn't happen again any time soon...Every time, people would stare and wonder to themselves — how was it even possible for such a little girl to be so strong?But all it took to allay their worries was seeing Varesa's soft, smiling face, and their children playing happily under her guidance. They were never worried that she would lose control of her strength."

    "text": "And in a way, they were right. Varesa never lost control of her strength — instead, it was her appetite that went unchecked.Perhaps this was her \"debt\" to pay for such strength. As soon as Varesa learned to walk, her appetite was already a match for any healthy youth in the tribe. When she was up to her parents' knees in height she could, in just one meal, demolish enough food to feed her whole family for an entire day — and that included Vanana.However, little Varesa's chances to show her strength were few and far between. With her diet, she soon started to \"resemble a Valberry from afar,\" until she reached a dangerously unhealthy weight, worrying her parents.For the sake of both her health and her ability to work in the future, her parents swiftly had her tending to the orchard. A great way, they thought, for her to burn off a bit of excess energy.After arriving in the orchard, Varesa made another unpleasant observation about herself.\"Mom, Dad, and Vanana do so much every day, but they don't eat much at all. I barely help out, yet I've been stuffing myself full...\"\"I have to work to make up for all the food I eat. I've gotta earn my keep!\"To her parents' delight, Varesa quickly got into the swing of things.At first, she took the lead and worked more, using her Tatankasaurus-like strength to carry around goods, farm equipment, and all sorts of other things. Hard labor came easy to her, like taking a walk after a meal to burn away her burgeoning energy.Later, under her mother's guidance, she set her mind to studying the finer details of farming — like soil management, nutrient mixing, and moisture regulation. Varesa took to these complex tasks with great gusto.As the future manager of the orchard, her daily workload far exceeded that of all her saurian helpers.Although she wasn't exactly a natural when it came to reading woven scrolls, understanding technical principles, and dealing with bookkeeping... Yet, having learned how to go out and purchase spices, Varesa could now manage the orchard on her own — something that even many adults would struggle with!Gradually, she managed to slim down a bit, such that her physique stabilized and she was no longer at risk of any serious health issues.However, even though she tried hard to suppress her cravings and live life with moderation... Yet still, little Varesa's appetite remained prodigious, to say the least.To that end, her parents had already taken her to get a diagnosis. However, to their surprise, the doctor simply praised her, saying, \"she's in great health, that's why she loves eating\" — so they could never figure out the cause.In the end, it was Chief Acatl who, having long been concerned about little Varesa, offered up a remarkably logical-sounding explanation:The fertile Teteocan soil can produce excellent crops to nourish its powerful warriors, but not all constitutions can fully utilize the energy stored within these foods. After eating the same meal, some people might only be able to do ten sets of bench presses, while others could carry the very same barbell up a mountain and still have the strength to do a war dance.But there are legends of dark horses — warriors of the Teteocan whose bodies, when necessary, could fully utilize every fiber and calorie in their meals, giving them unrivaled strength and a voracious appetite. That was probably the kind of person Varesa was.However, not all of these warriors went on to inherit Ancient Names or become heroes. Just like the skeleton of a ship or the foundation of a building, they served as cornerstones, their light shining in places unseen by others. But when the opportunity arose, they too could leave behind a brilliant legacy, and so they were sometimes known as \"hidden heroes.\"Hearing the chief's theory put Varesa's parents at ease. At the very least, their daughter had no serious health issues.As for little Varesa, all she took away from the conversation was that intriguing title...\"A 'hidden hero,' huh? So that's what I am?\""

    "character": "Varesa",
    "section": "Character Story 3",
    "text": "The phrase \"hidden hero\" had always stuck with little Varesa. Despite her youth, she had already come up with a more noble ambition:\"Since I'm special, shouldn't I work hard to become a real hero instead?\"However, the weight of the word \"hero\" was far beyond what little Varesa had first imagined...The hero triumphs over evil, leaving only a few choice words in their wake — such is the sacrifice of storytelling, which sweeps away most of the grief and hardship of the truth behind each fairy tale and every comic.To say nothing of real enemies who fought with true intent to kill, leaving Varesa more terrified than any wrestling match she'd ever watched.Varesa was five years old when she was first attacked by the Abyss. She relied on her instincts to kick the first monster that broke into her orchard, sending it flying. But when she saw the rest of them rushing towards her like a raging black tide, the little Varesa was so frightened that she collapsed, bursting into tears.Luckily, her father reacted in time. He drove off the nearby monsters, picked up Varesa and her mother, and brought Vanana with them to hide in their cellar. They sealed the door, then gently comforted their daughter as they awaited the Patrol Team's arrival.However, seeing her ruined orchard and the wounded warriors were what stopped little Varesa's tears. She clenched her tiny fists with such anger that she didn't even realize that her nails had pierced her palms.She did not understand the enemy's motives, nor did she intend to. All she knew was that they had destroyed her home, and hurt the nice grown-ups who came to buy her fruit so badly that some might never wake up... She hoped to become like the heroes in those stories, eliminating any Abyssal threats the instant they showed their misshapen faces.By the time she finished relocating and renovating the orchard with her parents, Varesa was no longer the carefree child she once was.With her parents' permission, Varesa, wearing a small mask and dragging along the heaviest barbell in the gym, pushed open the thick stone door that led to the wrestling arena's prep room. She begged the warriors within to teach her their ways.As a \"hidden hero,\" Varesa must face her fears and weaknesses. She must turn her brute strength into the power to protect her people.Some arrogant wrestlers looked down on Varesa for her youth, and turned her away. In response, she wordlessly grabbed them by the legs and dragged them into the ring, where she — in response to their bewildered expressions — gave them a light push. Her opponents were knocked off their feet, sent hurtling out of the arena, proving to all that Varesa's strength was not to be taken lightly.The warriors present, as well as Chief Acatl who had hurried over, briefly discussed the situation. In the end, Varesa's request was unanimously approved.In the eyes of the valiant warriors of the Collective of Plenty, seeing that Varesa had the strength to surpass any grown-up, she soon came to be regarded as a master of her craft.From then on, Varesa received tutelage under many great warriors. She did not know what fighting style suited her, so she relied on her impressions of heroes to try out their techniques one by one, keeping what worked best for her.She trained for years, but there was still a schism between theory and practice. Whenever she was in a real fight, whether by anxiety or lack of experience, she would still default to her instincts — charging at her enemies and launching a barrage of flying kicks. In her hands, melee weapons gained a new lease of life — namely, by being thrown straight at her foes...In response, some hilichurls started adopting similar \"ranged\" tactics to counter Varesa's onslaughts, resulting in Coach Iansan getting caught in the crossfire... The latter, who then started paying special attention to the young lass, henceforth took over all of Varesa's training.To help Varesa fully realize her potential, Iansan created a highly effective training program. Surprisingly, Varesa's natural talent ranked far above the rest of her trainees. Relying on just her intuition, she could effortlessly execute techniques that would require much backbreaking training from even Iansan's most devout disciples.Iansan believed that Varesa's strength might even surpass her own. Brimming with anticipation, she encouraged Varesa in the spirit of competition, saying, \"I won't lose to you!\" However, this only ended up leaving Varesa flustered and at a loss for words.During her training, Varesa defeated a four-digit number of monsters, but also broke a three-digit number of weapons, leaving a two-digit number of the tribe's warriors scratching their heads in disbelief. Iansan came to the following conclusion:Varesa was a genius with incredible strength, but it was precisely her strength that prevented her from using common melee weapons. Therefore, she should adopt the bare-handed fighting style of wrestlers to further grow as a warrior.At Iansan's recommendation, Varesa joined the tribe's Patrol Team. She frequently took to the front lines, striving to improve her fighting skills.And on her second month in the Patrol Team, Varesa once again faced a grueling trial.The black tide of monsters rushed at her once more. Her comrades were exhausted after three consecutive days of fighting, and even Varesa was reaching her limit...But it was in this very battle that Varesa found her second wind, and gained something precious to her — something that would make her an even more formidable warrior..."

    "text": "After experiencing that harsh battle, Varesa gradually returned to her peaceful self. Gaining more experience helped her ward off anxiety on the battlefield, even when under duress.She took over her family business, and her pace of living went back to how it was in her childhood.Deep down, she had always been an easy-going girl. In her own words, \"a laid-back life's a happy life.\"If she were to describe her usual routine, it would look something like this: \"Tend to the orchard, take care of Vanana, then drag the fruit cart around to each tribe to sell my stock... While I'm out, grab something fresh for lunch and dinner. If I run into the Epic Feast Showdown, all the better! This Inferno Stomach Supremo's gonna have herself a feast!\"\"Oh, and aside from that, don't forget to train according to Coach Iansan's plan every day — go through exercises on 18 gym machines, then three sets of 300 reps for three types of no-equipment full-body workouts, plus three shuttle run sessions of 30 thousand steps each... No need to stick to any strict timing, but just be careful not to startle passersby when training at night...\"When she receives the signal to report to the Patrol Team for duty, Varesa brings a massive backpack stuffed full of food, and follows her teammates around like she's on a field trip, looking for new spots to camp. When running into regular enemies, she dons her mask and gives them a generous serving of flying kicks — a show-stopping warmup, if ever there was one!Only when encountering the toughest of Abyssal foes does Varesa's fighting spirit burn truly bright.Such a disposition makes her ill-suited for certain situations, the most notable of which being the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame.As a famous warrior of the Collective of Plenty, everyone had always hoped that Varesa would achieve greatness in the Pilgrimage.But from the very moment she'd learned to fight, Varesa had never considered the other tribes' warriors to be her enemy. As a result, she was unable to take fights against her fellow Natlanese seriously... to the point that she fought like she was one of the fans in the stands.One time, the \"Sand Dagger of Seit'aad\" used his weapon to deflect an indecisive tackle from Varesa, causing her to crash headfirst into a cave, stumble inside, and get hopelessly lost. Guided by a Yumkasaurus Whelp, she only returned to the arena long after the team stage of the Pilgrimage had ended.Then there was another when Nusta, a veteran warrior of the Flower-Feather Clan, was showing off her punching techniques, and a pumped-up Varesa stopped to applaud her, totally oblivious to her surroundings. She did not even realize that Nusta's teammates had snuck off with the Sacred Flame until it was too late.Her strongest opponent was \"Malipo\" Kinich, who was on par with her speed, but far more agile. By dodging all around Varesa, Kinich effortlessly deflected her attacks, wore her out, and made an equally swift getaway with her team's Sacred Flame in tow...Varesa attempted the Pilgrimage five times, but never made it out of the team stage even once.Chief Acatl and Coach Iansan could only sigh and shrug. However, Varesa's parents and friends had no regrets, celebrating the despondent Varesa's return each time with a bounteous feast.If it had been anybody else, someone so strong being repeatedly knocked out so easily would surely have invited criticism. But the people of the Collective of Plenty, and even other tribes' warriors who had fought her, were sympathetic.Varesa often chats with her customers when selling her fruits. She is always calm, composed, and treats everyone like a friend. When customers pay slightly less, buy goods on temporary credit, or request returns or refunds, Varesa never shows the slightest hint of impatience. Her kind and laid-back demeanor convey a sense of comfort to all who cross paths with her.It would not be amiss to say that Varesa simply cannot muster up even an ounce of anger for her compatriots.Instead, Varesa knows that she should save her rage — a valuable resource to her — for the most important of battles. Being the bastion of the Patrol Team, Varesa has been a diligent soldier since the moment of her admission, and never once tasted defeat while defending the Collective of Plenty from the Abyss.But what is Varesa's own stance on all this? Is this truly enough for her?Participating in the Night Warden Wars, and facing the main force of the Abyss head-on is an indispensable milestone in Varesa's journey to becoming a hero.Evil never rests. To only intercept when the enemy strikes is an unsustainable approach.Varesa knew that if she failed to overcome her weaknesses by grasping the difference between unleashing her strength and giving in to anger, she might never become a true hero..."

    "text": "Sitting next to her tent and gazing at the campfire, Varesa has often wondered: What does the word \"hero\" mean to her?When she first set foot on the battlefield, Varesa was plagued by fear and trepidation. Back then, she chose to wear her mask, and would cry out \"By my spark, the night burns!\" to ignite her fighting spirit, thus overcoming her weakness.This soon became her modus operandi in battle. Once she had her mask on, she became a different person altogether — a hero who fought without fear.But even if her words and actions made her seem like a hero of legend... Could she truly call herself one?More importantly, why did she even want to become another hero?Did she envy their splendid swagger or desire to leave a trail of mighty feats in her wake for all to gush over?Or did she want to be able to channel the same kind of battle rage as her peers, to turn herself into a doubly-powerful instrument of war?After the greatest crisis had been resolved, with Natlan emerging victorious, Varesa heard the story of \"Tumaini,\" and slowly, things started clicking into place...Gradually, she realized that she neither hungered for glory, nor desired a permanent \"enemy\" to draw her rage.What she prized above all was the bravery and initiative of her heroes, as well as their courage in the face of their Abyssal foe.She wanted to turn their conviction into her strength, meting out her own brand of justice — to protect everyone so they could live peaceful lives, happy and carefree.Rather than hiding herself behind a mask, she should fight as herself — the one and only \"Varesa.\"She realized that it was imperative to confront her weaknesses head-on, as well as curb her sloppiness and bad habits.To this end, Varesa has been letting Iansan put her through \"enhanced control training,\" all while pushing herself harder than ever before. She now avoids wearing her mask in battle, and has stopped trying to imagine herself as one of her usual array of heroes.At first, she felt naked without her mask, and her subconscious dredged up memories of her rookie days, memories of weakness and panic. In her confusion, Varesa lost herself, forgetting even the basics of battle.But when the mind fails, the body takes over — namely, the techniques deeply ingrained into her muscle memory. Even though she wasn't able to use her full strength, and her lack of confidence led to her tripping and falling several times in front of her foes...Yet in the end, falling down was no big deal. She could, after all, use her superior strength to crash down with such force that her enemies lost their footing. Hey, as long as it worked...It's true that Varesa is still in the process of slowly adapting to the battlefield. Soon, she will be ready to join the fray, and unleash the coolest, most awesome fighting style of all — one that comes straight from her heart.This is Varesa in her prime as a warrior: someone who turns a fighting spirit born from \"wrath\" into the \"courage\" to face down her foes, colors the battlefield with the legacies of heroes past, and slams, dropkicks, and tackles her way to a beautiful victory!"

    "section": "A Hero's Mask",
    "text": "The first legendary hero that Varesa remembers hearing about, and the one who left the deepest impression on her, was Fietena.In artworks, she is usually portrayed with her favorite red battle mask. Known for her incredible speed and great skill in close combat, she was a warrior without equal.Born in the Collective of Plenty, Fietena achieved a great many victories in battle, not only at home but also in the defense of other tribes. Fietena eventually fell in love with a warrior from the Flower-Feather Clan and married into his family, strengthening relationships between both tribes.Overall, although Fietena's tale might not be as awe-inspiring as those of the heroes of the six Ancient Names, she remains a legend adored and respected by the people.As Natlan's graffiti has been influenced by foreign pop culture, its mediums of telling hero stories have constantly shifted with the times. In Varesa's beloved comics, where the art styles are often vibrant and over the top, Fietena's one-of-a-kind story has cemented her as an all-time favorite.The comic in which Fietena made her debut ended up being published in twelve volumes, with five different versions of her design.Whenever she visits the Children of Echoes, Varesa would learn some simple craftsmanship skills from its smiths. Eventually, she made replicas of all five of Fietena's masks for herself.Of these masks, she kept four in her collection. However, the mask from \"Night Warden Wars: Second Trial\" is special.This mask had the most thrilling backstory, but due to the large-scale battles in the comic — and the fact that Fietena was only visible from a few side-angles — it was difficult for Varesa to pick out its exact details, and there was no frontal depiction for her to use as a reference.So Varesa relied on her gut feeling to complete the pattern on the finished product, and it became a symbol of her giving her all in battle.In truth, due to Varesa's personal touches, there were already many differences between her mask and Fietena's.So much so that when people saw the masked Varesa, it was Varesa they thought of, not Fietena.Once she learned of this unanimous verdict, Varesa was not only slightly disappointed, but even a little sad.Nevertheless, whenever she completed her tasks in the Patrol Team, fulfilling her duty to safeguard the Collective of Plenty and its surrounding areas, people would always approach her to offer their gratitude.They would give her gifts of her favorite foods, as well as beautiful handmade ornaments.And to place emphasis on thanking Varesa herself, people would always draw a little mask on every thank-you letter they gave her. Over time, the mask came to be seen as Varesa's personal emblem.To this, Coach Iansan nodded her head in satisfaction:\"Fietena's heroic deeds will always be remembered by the people. But what happens today and tomorrow, that's your masterpiece in the making. Accept it, Varesa, and embrace it — it's a sign of everyone's encouragement!\"Hearing her coach's advice, Varesa made up her mind and set herself a lofty goal:\"If, one day, I really manage to become a true hero, and people make stories about me... a—and even make me the protagonist in a comic... then let's officially make this 'Varesa's Mask'!\""

    "section": "Vision",
    "text": "On numerous occasions, Varesa has recounted a nightmare she once had in which she was fighting an endless horde of Abyssal foes, knocking down one, only for ten more to spring up in its place.Many of the tribe's warriors understood that this was no dream, and that such a horrific battle did, in fact, take place.At that time, the Abyssal forces had launched a cunning three-way assault on the Collective of Plenty when the Tollan Volcano was in its eruption cycle. They sought to isolate, corner, and exterminate the tribal warriors.The attack happened so suddenly that the only reinforcements to arrive were a handful of couriers from the Scions of the Canopy. As far as the Collective of Plenty's warriors were concerned, they were practically on their own.With their limited manpower, the drawn-out fighting soon wore their defenses down on all sides. After careful deliberation, the tribe's elders decided to decentralize and layer their defenses, deploying their front lines as far away from civilian areas as possible. The reinforcements from the Scions of the Canopy could not join the fighting directly, and were ordered to occupy as much of the high ground as they could.Meanwhile, the Collective of Plenty planned to deploy a number of its elite warriors to launch a counteroffensive.The tribe's lines of defense could not halt the Abyssal forces completely, but their responsibility was to slow them down and deplete their strength.Once the Abyssal forces had been slowed, the Collective of Plenty would change tactics — they would have the Scions of the Canopy's couriers identify and track down the enemy leaders.Following this, the tribe's counteroffensive would ambush the enemy leaders from behind and take them down. After cutting off the head of the serpent, the only thing left would be to deal with its flailing body...When Varesa, new to the Patrol Team, heard that she could engage the enemy leaders if she joined the counteroffensive, she signed up right there on the spot.Acatl and Iansan were concerned, but they needed as much support as they could get, and Varesa was indeed a formidable warrior. In the end, they agreed to let her join.Though the strategy was sound, putting it into practice was treacherous, to say the least.During the first counterattack, Varesa, along with ten warriors, rushed into the enemy lines, and felled their leader with great gusto.During the second counterattack, Varesa was joined by only six warriors. The enemies' weapons, normally a breeze to evade and parry, cut closer and closer to their necks each time.During the final counterattack, Iansan, the backbone of the tribe's defenses, fought with all her might to clear a path. When she turned around, she realized that only Varesa was left...Varesa hobbled over, covered in wounds. She carried an older fellow warrior over her left shoulder, whom she handed over to Iansan. In her right hand, she dragged along the twisted, broken body of a mitachurl which she hurled into the enemy horde, sending a great number of monsters flying.Varesa's eyes, clouded and hazy, revealed that she was barely conscious on her feet. But her body continued to fight at full strength, driven by rage and responsibility alike.With trembling hands, she took out her tattered mask from her pocket. She put it on, whispering to herself:\"I'm not that scared little girl anymore. I want to fight like a hero.\"As soon as the words left her mouth, and without waiting for Iansan, Varesa dug her heels into the ground, which cracked and splintered under the force. She flung herself at the enemy leader in a blazing, crimson flash, tearing through the surrounding ranks of monsters.After a few moments, a thunderous roar erupted from the depths of the Abyssal horde. What remained of their leader was sent blasting upwards, tracing a beautiful arc through the sky...When the dust had settled, Iansan got to digging, and eventually found Varesa buried in the depths of the ruined battlefield, fast asleep. But the Vision in her grasp was clearly wide awake, for it wreathed her body in crackling bursts of lightning.Varesa remained unconscious for half a month. When she finally awoke, she could not remember a single thing about the battle. By then, her wounds had miraculously healed, and she was fit as a fiddle once more.Hearing the praises of the people around her, regarding her new Vision, and enjoying her victory banquet, Varesa knew only that she had done herself proud. At the very least... she didn't end up letting everyone down.In other words, there was no need to think too much about it all. And after working so hard, it was now time to eat hard instead!"

I find the sound of her voice so reassuring, and the look in her eyes is so inspiring and encouraging. It makes me want to push myself as hard as I possibly can every single day.

Wherever there was a thorny issue to be solved or someone in distress, he was always among the first to know and would rush to the scene to get involved.<!--\n              -->When people would praise his kind-heartedness, he would smile at their warm words. Unbeknownst to them, he was mostly just thrilled to be in the thick of the action — people's problems getting solved was merely a happy coincidence.<!--\n              -->However, Mondstadt was enjoying a long period of peace, and the everyday troubles of its citizens were insufficient to satisfy Dahlia's appetite for excitement — curbside quarrels, drinking debts, and absconded animals were far too nondescript for his tastes.<!--\n              -->And whenever something truly thrilling would arise, the elite Knights of Favonius were always on hand to swiftly restore mundane order.<!--\n              -->Thus, after returning his 19th lost cat and clearing his 30th Slime-induced key road blockage of the year, it occurred to Dahlia that he needed to inject some real turbulence into his life.<!--\n              -->When he felt the winds begin to blow, he picked a single dandelion and held it in the palm of his hand, praying to Barbatos that something new and exciting might happen to him.<!--\n              -->The dandelion seeds spiraled into the air and were carried on the wind to the plaza before the great Church of Favonius, coming to rest on the outstretched fingers of the Anemo Archon's statue.<!--\n              -->In the plaza, a bard was playing a chelys, a child was feeding the pigeons, and the denizens of Mondstadt were praying before the Archon's statue.<!--\n              -->Yet Dahlia could sense something was off amid this idyllic scene — that keen nose of his had detected the slightest whiff of trouble.<!--\n              -->There were two sisters nearby talking in hushed and solemn voices. Dahlia sidled up beside them and managed to just about catch the words \"missing\" and \"urgent.\"<!--\n              -->In line with his standard approach to \"meddling,\" he politely approached the two sisters and inquired if they needed his help.<!--\n              -->They glanced at each other uncertainly, not sure whether they should involve a layperson in their current quandary.<!--\n              -->Dahlia patted his chest reassuringly, announcing himself as a devout believer in the church and stating that there would be no greater honor than to help.<!--\n              -->Moved by his impassioned words, the sisters ultimately explained the situation — one of their fellow sisters had been missing for several days, leaving the work she had been tasked with undone.<!--\n              -->And so it was that Dahlia came to undertake this sister's work \"for the benefit of the people of Mondstadt.\""

The clergy would usually take it in turns to complete this task, but though it was now Sister Rosaria's turn, she had left the city on an investigation and had not been heard from in days. As such, the letters were piling up.<!--\n              -->Dahlia took a deep breath and set about opening letters as though he were unwrapping candy.<!--\n              -->Like a snowdrift in a blizzard, the letters piled high around him. All the troubles that people felt unable to share with their neighbors and friends were laid bare before him on white paper snowflakes.<!--\n              -->Dahlia read each one carefully. Fortunately, most of these troubles were well within his power to solve.<!--\n              -->A young maid confessed that she had fallen for someone beyond her reach and was uncertain whether to pursue things further. Dahlia wrote in his reply: The most beautiful emotions are often those we leave obscured, yet a brave decision can sometimes bring joyful rewards. Both are fine choices, so perhaps you should let your heart decide?<!--\n              -->A merchant complained that their business was going nowhere, and they could not give their family the life they deserved. Dahlia wrote in his reply: A modest return is always better than a loss. Remain patient and be on the lookout for new opportunities. Perhaps in time, your fortunes will change.<!--\n              -->A scholar questioned the history of Old Mondstadt. Dahlia cited records from authoritative texts and gently reminded the scholar that perhaps only Barbatos himself could help one learn the truth of the past.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->On the morning of the third day, Dahlia was still furiously scribbling at his desk when his door was gently pushed ajar to admit a tired-looking sister. There were stains on her clothes that might have been mud but could well have been blood.<!--\n              -->\"You must be the sister who's been missing these past few days... It looks like the work you've been doing was far from easy.\"<!--\n              -->\"Thank you for your help, stranger. Victoria appreciates your kindness. She's hoping to persuade you to stay here and work with us.\" Rosaria began relaying the things she'd heard upon her return to the church.<!--\n              -->As far as Dahlia was concerned, helping the church and working for the church were two completely different things. The latter involved far more than simply assisting the congregation in solving their problems — it required spending a significant amount of time on monotonous prayer and ceremony. For Dahlia, dull repetition was the greatest enemy of all.<!--\n              -->He shot up from his chair, hurriedly declaring, \"I seek no payment but the joy of helping others! Anyway... now that you're back, my work here is done!\"<!--\n              -->Rosaria made no move to stop him from leaving. She simply looked on as he fled the scene like a sudden gust of wind.<!--\n              -->Upon reading through the pile of responses left sitting on her desk, she instantly regretted allowing him to leave without first learning his address.<!--\n              -->She made a note to find out where he lived before the next time she was tasked with penning replies to the people's letters..."

As such, he decided to accompany the singer for a round or three.<!--\n              -->He gently probed, hoping to tactfully uncover the source of the bard's troubles. Was he suffering from writer's block? Had his latest work received negative reviews? Were his performances not bringing in enough money?<!--\n              -->In the end, after downing his 28th cup of apple cider, the bard joyfully shared his reason for drinking:<!--\n              -->The fruit harvest that year had been a good one, and the wine it produced tasted exceptionally sweet. The bard explained how once he had got going, he had found it difficult to stop until the room was spinning and his eyes glazed over.<!--\n              -->...It appeared he was simply a connoisseur of fine wine.<!--\n              -->So Dahlia paid for the remaining drinks and ordered round after round, until the two of them were not only satisfied and sated, but had become the firmest of friends.<!--\n              -->And so, when Dahlia arranged to meet Venti atop the city walls to share his adventures of the past few days, he made sure to bring libations.<!--\n              -->Venti was curious to know why he had fled. When common folk encountered trouble in their lives, they would often seek the Church's aid. Surely, that was exactly the role Dahlia wanted?<!--\n              -->He thought back to his childhood, when his mother would take him along to morning prayers. He had always found these occasions too solemn and gloomy. He would think up ways to slip away or doodle absentmindedly on the pews. If he were to join the ranks of the clergy, these rituals were certain to become a regular part of his routine.<!--\n              -->Not to mention, the thought of all those weighty tomes filled with scripture made him dizzy.<!--\n              -->Venti gave a laugh and then asked again — if there was a way to make the rituals more interesting, would he consider it then? For instance, what if he were to help transmit the Anemo Archon's guidance to his flock?<!--\n              -->Well, there was no way Dahlia was going to turn down an opportunity like that.<!--\n              -->And thus, that night, it came to pass that Dahlia became the guardian of a scarcely believable secret, while Barbatos, in turn, gained a most trustworthy herald."

This time, he claimed to be an oracle, bearing the words of Barbatos himself — words which required their help to pass on to the people.<!--\n              -->Those present were understandably unsure. There had been many cases of charlatans abusing the Archon's name to defraud the common folk, but seldom had anyone attempted to hoodwink the clergy themselves.<!--\n              -->Although, as Dahlia had a reputation for finding joy in helping others, the sisters were divided — some supported helping him while others remained unconvinced.<!--\n              -->Those who were opposed believed that should this \"oracle\" prove false, it would damage the reputation of the church. While those who were in favor felt that oracular proclamations were nothing more than suggestions — should the things they predicted not come to pass, it would be of little significance to the common folk. However, should true prophecies be ignored, great harm could potentially be done.<!--\n              -->After everyone had carefully weighed the benefits and risks, those who supported helping the \"oracle\" spread his word found themselves in the ascendancy.<!--\n              -->Therefore, Victoria noted down Dahlia's enlightened words and proclaimed them to the faithful at morning prayers. After a few days, all of his predictions were proven true — timely rains fell for several straight days after Dahlia's call to plant seeds was followed, while a ferocious storm arose on the day he had called for none to take their boats out to sea, and on the day when he decreed the hunters should hunt, their captured prey was doubled...<!--\n              -->During this time, rumors of a \"youth blessed by gods\" spread like wildfire throughout the church and the wider world.<!--\n              -->The result was that the church formally offered Dahlia the position of deacon — a position he readily accepted.<!--\n              -->On the first day that Dahlia conducted morning prayers, the Cathedral was packed to the rafters with common folk who had heard tell of his abilities. They enthusiastically told him their problems, hoping that they might receive divine guidance.<!--\n              -->Even the longest-serving sisters had never witnessed such scenes.

I shall try to focus on the most important questions.\"<!--\n              -->Dahlia answered the people's questions in an orderly manner before publicly announcing the date of his next time leading morning prayers.<!--\n              -->Thanks to Barbatos's blessings, morning prayers were no longer the solemn and stuffy occasion they had once been, and there was now one more reason for people to come to church."

As Victoria put it, only an appearance from Barbatos himself would sway her mind.<!--\n              -->Dahlia could see it was a lost cause and quietly put the idea aside.<!--\n              -->Until that year's Weinlesefest, that is, where Dahlia personally performed the ode — accompanied by Venti, of course — across multiple days of the festival.<!--\n              -->And so it was that the hymn became popular throughout the city. Indeed, no matter which street you walked along back then, you could always hear its refrains carried on the wind from somewhere nearby."

    "text": "Deacon Dahlia's name blew through the streets of Mondstadt like the lilting notes of a hymn. Even the cats, sunning themselves on the roofs and pavements, would meow in response to hearing it.<!--\n              -->Those he had helped would smile and say, \"Oh, I remember that Dahlia!\" While those who had once been the object of his snooping interventions would turn up their noses and snort:<!--\n              -->\"How did that nosy so-and-so manage to climb so high, anyway? Come on, it's our turn to make some sport of him!\"<!--\n              -->The shuffling sounds of massing feet were swallowed in the cavernous hall of the Cathedral. The only sound that could be heard beneath the dappled light from the stained glass windows was Dahlia's voice. His words were clear and simple, yet conveyed a sense of gravity...<!--\n              -->\"That's not right...\" A voice cried out, finally seizing the chance to challenge him. \"Where in the scripture does it say that? I can find no such words!\"<!--\n              -->Those nearby turned their irate gazes upon this unwelcome speaker, and a well-minded stranger attempted to explain:<!--\n              -->\"Barbatos is the god of freedom, his words are not constrained by scripture...\"<!--\n              -->Dahlia calmly cleared his throat, his composure unwavering, a flicker of excitement dancing across his brow:<!--\n              -->\"No one can seize the wind that does not wish to dally. Yet now that this wind would grasp our hands, some stubbornly seek to trap it in the pages of a book.\"<!--\n              -->This was simply an interlude, and as the speaker had not achieved their goal of humiliating Dahlia, they had no choice but to turn and walk unhappily away — in full view of everyone.<!--\n              -->Yet when Dahlia returned home, he retrieved his book of scripture — as thick and heavy as a slab of rock — gently blew the dust off its covers, and began to read it word by word, until he knew its contents by heart.<!--\n              -->No one had required him to do so, and Dahlia had never feared if others should question him.<!--\n              -->Whether people believed him or not, he was Barbatos's herald. And because he was Barbatos's herald, he knew that the Anemo Archon was not some solemn deity who would leave behind sermons and commandments. This so-called scripture was, at its heart, a book of Mondstadt's history, of praise for the Anemo Archon, of gratitude for plenty, and of hopes for freedom — it had little to do with Barbatos himself.<!--\n              -->But Dahlia understood that he was no longer the common, excitable citizen of Mondstadt that he had once been. He was a deacon of the Church of Favonius. His every word and every action was a representation of the church and of Barbatos. It would not be hard for him to give out the same quick, impromptu responses he had always done, but was that what the church and its followers truly needed?<!--\n              -->A few days later, when Dahlia was once again holding morning prayers, the congregation noticed something different in his bearing. His movements were solemn, his speech notably full of purpose. His words now flowed like the finest poetry as the warm light from the stained glass windows reflected in his eyes...<!--\n              -->By the time he had finished, even Victoria couldn't help but ask if Barbatos himself hadn't stopped by to give him some inspirational pointers.<!--\n              -->He lifted his head, thinking of the Vision he had found lying like a bookmark on his tome of scriptures, and which he had now affixed to his robes.<!--\n              -->\"Perhaps fate smiles on those who are most diligent?\" He gave Victoria a wink and flashed her a cryptic smile.<!--\n              -->What he left unsaid is that he had already changed for the benefit of others. He now desired to use his power to guide the world along a brighter path."

Whenever there's a major crisis, Barbatos's guidance is usually pretty concise and intuitive, but I have to find ways of adding in some sacred-sounding rhetoric so it comes across as more convincing and inspires people to action. Like this: \"Verily, the returning wind shall carry the dew of the heavens. O children of the Anemo Archon, have your seeds not been sown? Then be patient, and from the land where you have toiled shall spring forth blessings from on high.\" All that really means is: \"Get planting, because it's gonna rain soon.\" But obviously, the former sounds much more like the sacred words of an oracle, right?

Although Watatsumi Island lacks manpower and , its people have managed to turn the tide of battle many times thanks to Kokomi's tactical prowess.

She does not know when it started, but interacting with people eventually became tiresome to her.Having ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, Kokomi had no choice but to learn many things that she wasn't any good at before, whether it was dealing with people or performing duties that she had little interest in.However, forcing herself to do things she holds little love for is a serious drain on her energy reserves, leaving her feeling quite exhausted.As such, Kokomi set up an \"energy\" system of measurement for herself. When she does things she enjoys, her energy levels will increase, and the reverse is true when she trudges through unenjoyable slogs.When she runs out of this energy, Kokomi will temporarily put her duties as the Divine Priestess aside and resume being an ordinary homebody.Engrossing herself in the close reading of a book on military strategy, walling herself off from the rest of the world — thus does Kokomi reclaim a temporary respite from her busy existence.These moments are of utmost value to her."

Was this the role of the Divine Priestess speaking? Or was this a product of her own sense of duty? Or perhaps... it was a bit of both?As the Divine Priestess, Kokomi naturally has her own Vision.

One day many moons later, when he met the Witch of Purple Rose, Lisa, he began to study human knowledge.\"Friends, hurt... Never again!

    "text": "Whether you're a tourist visiting Fontaine for the first time or an adventurer who's set their heart on finding legendary treasures, you're sure to be captivated by the enchantments of the underwater world. But those who attempt to explore the depths without first undergoing rigorous training or making the necessary preparations are gambling with their lives. Treacherous underwater currents, unexpected bodily reactions, and monsters lurking in the deep... Peril always comes without knocking. Seeking the help of a professional diver is always a wise choice.<!--\n              -->If you ask people who's the most talented diver around, you're likely to hear the name of Freminet. Even old veterans, bronzed and toughened by long exposure to the elements, never tire of lauding his skills. They speak not only of his familiarity with Fontaine's complex hydrological systems, but also of his prowess in coping with different underwater environments and seasonal conditions, as well as his expert control over his breathing. He seems to swim wherever he pleases — even through caverns deep down on the ocean floor, where no one else dares to venture...<!--\n              -->When many people hear this, they suddenly think of something or other that Freminet could do for them. But no matter how great the promised rewards, the veterans always respond the same way – with a shake of the head and a regretful sigh.<!--\n              -->\"The boy wouldn't hear of it... He's a nice lad, just a bit too shy.\"<!--\n              -->The conversation usually stops here.<!--\n              -->As Freminet sees it, other people's compliments are as capricious as the weather. He finds it hard to fathom their true intentions, and is constantly worried that he'll put his foot in it by saying something wrong.<!--\n              -->Perhaps his true friends are the Tidalga and Romaritime Flowers that he spends so much time with. They hold a much dearer place in his heart than do reputation and reward, which float around on the surface. When he dives, he stays silent for long periods of time in the company of his old friends, and lets the silence swallow up his fears and anxieties. In so doing, he lets out all the things weighing on his mind, all the things that he can't say to anyone else.<!--\n              -->The reason he chose to dive was that simple — to find some peace and quiet, and escape everything happening in the world above."

    "text": "Even before he received his Vision, Freminet used to love wearing his diving helmet and exploring the underwater world like a penguin.<!--\n              -->He was never a very talkative child, and whenever something upset him he would plunge into the ocean, leaving his worries on the dry land far above. Over time, the quiet seabed became like a cradle to him, somewhere where he could curl up and feel safe. As the rings of a tree grow outward with each passing year, so too did his curiosity for the underwater world. He listened to the ocean currents with his body, and with each breath grew closer to the water around him. He committed every aspect of Fontaine's hydrology to memory, as if he were memorizing roads around a new home, albeit with far more relish. Eventually, he discovered a place of extraordinary beauty which captured his heart, and built a little secret underwater base nearby. Here, he could let his sunken emotions shine forth with a radiance akin to that of a Lumitoile.<!--\n              -->To this day, when faced with a particularly thorny problem, Freminet's first thought is to escape to this deep blue sanctuary — so vast and magnanimous that it could embrace all things.<!--\n              -->Free, tranquil, safe, and content... If Freminet were to tell others how the underwater world makes him feel, he would most probably be met with more than a few raised eyebrows.<!--\n              -->But Freminet would never do this. In his mind, this is his ocean, and his alone. These feelings, hidden deep in his heart, are like sunken treasures buried in the depths."

    "text": "In the eyes of an onlooker, Freminet doesn't have much of a presence, and comes across as cold almost to the point of being pessimistic. He's always silent, alone, and doesn't seem to enjoy the company of his peers. Compared to his older brother — the legendary Great Magician Lyney — Freminet seems as dull as a piece of old, soon-to-be-forgotten jewelry. But he doesn't care what they think.<!--\n              -->A long time ago, Freminet began trying to strip away excess emotions to prevent his being affected by external pressures.<!--\n              -->As if building an igloo in his heart, he piled up block after block until he had constructed a translucent refuge, and curled up inside. Clutching his knees, the only thing that gave him solace was reading fairytales.<!--\n              -->If diving underwater was a way to steal a moment of peace, then sealing himself in a sanctuary of solid ice was actually a way to stay warm.<!--\n              -->Freminet would only ever invite his closest \"kin\" in, and even then, he'd insist on tidying up first, making sure to lock his fairytales away.<!--\n              -->By the time Freminet left, he'd already turned into a clockwork toy — exquisitely made, yet silent as ever.<!--\n              -->He once found himself floating on his back upon the waters, unconcerned with his own safety, listening to the unknown songs of Violetgold Angler Gulls circling overhead. In hindsight, it was fortunate that they hadn't mistaken him for a fish...<!--\n              -->It was in that moment that he discovered how easy it was to just let the currents carry him away.<!--\n              -->No matter who was asking, and no matter what they wanted, as long as he followed orders unquestionably without a thought for the consequences — like an angler bringing home their catch — he would no longer have to face the endless cycle of castigation and punishment.<!--\n              -->In the years that children from ordinary families ran about laughing, showing off the latest clockwork toys or picking up phrases from The Steambird, Freminet's heart was gradually becoming numb. Orders filled the void and became like a clockwork spring driving him forward.<!--\n              -->He used to fantasize about turning into a cold, cruel machine, driven only by the imperative to execute commands. But as he matured, he became increasingly aware of his essential weakness. He wanted to leave emotions behind, but there were too many feelings that he couldn't just cast aside. They would always come back in the dead of night, suddenly gripping him like seaweed wrapping around his limbs. His habit of avoiding problems, his worry that he would not complete his tasks well, his fear of annoying people with his lack of enthusiasm, and his dread of disappointing others — those who meant something to him, most of all...<!--\n              -->He wasn't an outstanding child, but he simply became hypersensitive to everything in the world he grew up in.<!--\n              -->He hid himself within a thick shell and yielded to his timidity, until he could only express himself underwater."

    "text": "Freminet was born in the Fleuve Cendre region of Fontaine. Each night he would fall asleep to the sound of drunkards belting out off-key shanties, and wake up to the shrill cries of neighbors cursing outside his window.<!--\n              -->Freminet never met his own father, but he heard from his mother that the man was knee-deep in debt. He had little idea what all these numbers meant, and they were as hard for the little boy to conceive as a dinner in the Palais Mermonia. What he did know was that they were the reason his mother worked from dawn till dusk, day in day out.<!--\n              -->When he was home alone, Freminet would often quietly fiddle about with the few devices there were in the house — a portable lamp that never lit up, a wall clock that never ticked, and so on...<!--\n              -->These things had been lying around for as long as he could remember, as if they were guests who had stopped by for a quick rest after a long saunter, but had never woken back up. Freminet found some tools and, one by one, carefully took them apart. To him, the inner structures of these mechanisms were like mysterious labyrinths. Turn this part here, and another would move as a result. Tap that bit there, and something else would spring out...<!--\n              -->When he was with these machines, Freminet felt the same way he did when he read fairytales — like he had taken a magic potion that shrunk him down to the same size as the components. He was moving through a world of cogs and clockwork parts where time seemed to pass without his knowledge. These friends of his, silent yet intriguing, kept him company through many a lonely day.<!--\n              -->One day, when his mother returned home, she suddenly heard a strange noise that stopped her in her tracks. It was the sound of their clock, which Freminet had unwittingly fixed, ticking away almost as if to celebrate the new lease on life he had given it. She caressed his head and praised him, filling his heart with joy. But when he woke up the following morning, the clock was nowhere to be found. When his mother came home that evening, she brought him two slices of a type of bread he'd never had before. He still remembers the taste to this day.<!--\n              -->From that day forth, his mother brought back all kinds of different devices for him — everything from clockwork toys to miniature clocks. Freminet liked his new friends a lot, and would spend a long time \"waking\" them from their slumber, even though they always vanished the following day.<!--\n              -->But one day, when Freminet ran over excitedly to greet his mother at the door, he had something very special with him — an exquisitely-made music box pendant, about the size of a person's thumb. It had been in such a terrible state when she had found it by the roadside that it was to their great surprise to discover that it still worked.<!--\n              -->A beautiful melody jingled away between them, and seeing Freminet's innocent face light up with pure joy, a rare smile broke out on his mother's, too.<!--\n              -->This pendant would not leave him, for every evening, his mother would carefully take it off her neck, and together they would listen to its sweet lullaby as night fell."

    "text": "One day, without uttering a word, Freminet's mother took him by the hand and led him away. As he tried to keep up behind her, little Freminet's palm began to hurt from the strength of her grip.<!--\n              -->\"Mom, where are we going?\" He asked. She didn't reply.<!--\n              -->\"Mommy, why are you crying?\" He asked her again. She suddenly stopped and let out a sob, but only a single one.<!--\n              -->Afterwards, as if resolved to plunge into the freezing depths of the ocean, she took several deep breaths and continued onward. Not another tear fell, but in the oppressive silence Freminet had a vague sense that an ominous current was about to crash against the reef of his future.<!--\n              -->Finally, they arrived in front of an unfamiliar house. As the thick door opened, it let out a harsh creak. It was the type of door that you intuitively knew that, once closed, could never be opened again.<!--\n              -->Still, his mother remained silent. It was as if her expression, weighed down by her heavy heart, had sunk into a bottomless ocean.<!--\n              -->\"Freminet, correct?\" Said a woman as she stepped out. \"Come with me.\"<!--\n              -->Confused, Freminet looked up at his mother. He could feel the tide surging beneath him.<!--\n              -->Calling herself the \"director\", the woman took his other wrist and began to pull him in.<!--\n              -->All of a sudden his mother's grip tightened, becoming even tighter than when she had led him over. Freminet felt like a boat caught between two waves, completely helpless as they each pulled in opposite directions and showed no sign of letting go.<!--\n              -->At last, his mother slowly bent down, half-kneeling before him. This was what she would do each day when she said goodbye to him before leaving the house.<!--\n              -->\"Be a good boy,\" she said, kissing Freminet on the forehead in the way she always did.<!--\n              -->These tender words rose up like a barrier before the jagged reef, instantly turning the raging current into a soft, warm flow.<!--\n              -->So that's all this is, Freminet thought to himself. Perhaps, like ever and always, this was just to be a brief parting after all.<!--\n              -->He nodded to set her at ease.<!--\n              -->The director continued to pull him inside, and this time, his mother didn't try to stop her. Just like that, she let go...<!--\n              -->For a long time after, Freminet truly believed that as long as he behaved and performed well enough, his mother would come to bring him back home. That her kind face, disappearing behind that thick door, would someday reappear. And parting his fringe, she would kiss him on the forehead once again to tell him how well he'd done.<!--\n              -->But that day never came.<!--\n              -->\"Still haven't figured it out? You were sold to settle a debt.\"<!--\n              -->As he grew up, Freminet started to have doubts about where his mother had gone and his own fate. After he finally plucked up the courage to ask the director, this was the heartless response she gave him.<!--\n              -->\"You were abandoned, child. This is the only home you have.\" \"If you don't follow orders, your mother's safety can't be guaranteed...\" Such were the words of the previous director, callous as spiked shackles, locking his wildest hopes inside that door forever. These invisible fetters left a mark of utter abjection on Freminet. In those days, the ocean depths were his sole escape.<!--\n              -->Engulfed by icy-cold seawater, he always felt that little bit closer to her. After all, when those events had transpired all those years ago, had she not sunk to the bottom of the ocean herself? Yet those waters must have been far colder than any he had ever dived in."

    "text": "After \"Father\" replaced the previous director, Freminet's thoughts began to turn to finding his mother once again.<!--\n              -->At first, Freminet assumed that she would rile up a still greater storm of brutality, for he knew that her methods were brutal, and he expected new orders to be given just as pitilessly as they had been in the past. But he soon discovered that \"Father's\" way of doing things was utterly different.<!--\n              -->With \"Father,\" the home was a place of refuge for all the family's children, and as such required a collective effort to maintain. It was up to each of them to complete their tasks in the way that best suited them. Even if they failed, they wouldn't be subjected to the searingly painful punishments they had been previously.<!--\n              -->This taste of freedom finally gave Freminet the chance to breathe deeply, and he started searching for his mother's whereabouts in his free time.<!--\n              -->But a long time passed and he still wasn't any closer to finding her.<!--\n              -->Perhaps I really was abandoned, Freminet thought, trying to convince himself to accept reality as he strained to summon the already vague memory of his mother's face.<!--\n              -->But just as he was thinking of giving up, \"Father\" threw him a pendant.<!--\n              -->\"I found this at the base of operations of those scum. Keep it.\" said \"Father.\"<!--\n              -->Freminet looked back at her, perplexed, which in turn seemed to confuse her.<!--\n              -->\"What it is? I'm talking about those usurious scoundrels. It belonged to your mother...\" She frowned, seeming to suddenly realize something. \"What were you told about her?\"<!--\n              -->Freminet told her what the previous director had said to him, about how he had been abandoned. As he did so, she said nothing, but her eyes began to burn with wrath.<!--\n              -->After Freminet was finished, \"Father\" fell silent for a rare moment. \"Do you want to know what really happened?\" She asked, fixing him with a piercing stare.<!--\n              -->Freminet nodded almost unconsciously. But once he had heard what she had to say, he wasn't sure which story he'd rather believe.<!--\n              -->\"Father\" told Freminet that his mother hadn't abandoned him, but on the contrary, had acted to protect him...<!--\n              -->That year, the debt that his family owed finally reached the point where they would no longer be able to repay it. Those greedy moneylenders had not only forced Freminet's mother to hand over the house that they lived in, but had also demanded that she hand over Freminet as well. But she was his mother — how could she let this happen? In the end, she had no choice but to entrust Freminet to \"that orphanage\" — somewhere they could never get at him — and then face them alone.<!--\n              -->\"This was all I found. As for your mother...\" As she looked at the young boy in front of her, still gripping the pendant tightly in his hands, \"Father\" trailed off and left the ensuing silence to speak for her.<!--\n              -->Freminet's head hung low, but knowing his personality, \"Father\" slipped out of the room without another word. The boy was left standing there, shaking as he gazed down at the pendant in his hands. It had long since rusted and could no longer produce sounds, and the clockwork components seemed to have been stained dark brown by dried blood. She must have been holding it at the very end, he thought. In his despair, Freminet continued to stare at the pendant, desperately looking for even a thread of his mother's warmth.<!--\n              -->That evening, Freminet dived down to the bottom of the ocean and let it all out. He couldn't remember the last time he had cried like this. Other than the Romaritime Flowers that wept alongside him, not a soul heard the sound of his sobbing, for the ocean smothered it utterly.<!--\n              -->From that day on, his grip on his greatsword tightened. He made an oath to himself that he would never again let another member of his family meet with misfortune."

His vision grew hazy, and he couldn't tell whether it was the reflection of some monstrous leviathan or a sign that he was on the verge of fainting.<!--\n              -->No. Wait. The diving equipment was malfunctioning! Was it just him? If not, how many of the others were affected?<!--\n              -->He tried hard to open his eyes, but he was gradually and uncontrollably slipping out of consciousness.<!--\n              -->No, I have to lead them back, he said to himself. As long as my arms and legs keep working...<!--\n              -->He began to feel sleepy.<!--\n              -->His thoughts were becoming sluggish... If this carries on, he thought, I'm never going to make it to the surface.<!--\n              -->Even if I make it, what good would it do? That thought suddenly flashed through Freminet's mind. I'd just go back to living day after day after day, eternally devoid of hope.<!--\n              -->He felt tired. Tired of forcing himself to keep going.<!--\n              -->He was unsuited to having so many \"family members.\" There was no real warmth or feelings between them. They were simply a motley crew of clockwork meka, each of a slightly different model and outward appearance.<!--\n              -->Perhaps the seawater was where he belonged after all. To drift off into blissful sleep... Was it really so bad? He gradually let his eyes fall shut.<!--\n              -->A sound suddenly jerked him back awake. Freminet... Freminet. The voice was slow, solemn, and seemed to be coming from the other end of the earth. It also carried a slight stutter.<!--\n              -->Pers?<!--\n              -->Freminet stretched out his arms to a blank landscape in front of him, opening his eyes in puzzlement.<!--\n              -->There was no Pers the penguin in this underwater realm. The children had all slipped into a dreadful torpor.<!--\n              -->I must save them all! Freminet screamed without making a sound. So what if we're not all of the same mind? I won't abandon anyone in my family! No matter what hazards lie ahead, only with the courage to put life itself on the line will I live to see the blue sky that comes after the storm.<!--\n              -->In that moment, his body seemed to be imbued with power, and even his breathing grew easy once more. He quickly swam over to his companions, who were each of them drowning...<!--\n              -->In the midst of a tempest, he saved all of his friends — a miracle of heroism worthy of the legendary Pers from the stories he so loved...<!--\n              -->It was only then that he realized that a Vision as clear as crystal now hung from his divesuit.<!--\n              -->He never told a soul what really happened that day. After all, true heroes aren't in it for the recognition."

Thus, she constantly looked for ways to make a change.Every day when she woke up in the morning, she would look at herself in the mirror and massage her face with her fingers to stretch and relax her eyes a little.She would even practice smiling and study expressions — verbal and facial alike — of great elegance.After a significant amount of practice, she once came across a group of children bullying another child, and instinctually she went over to rescue the bullied child.She gave the kid what she thought was a friendly smile and a gentle pat on the head. To say that the upset child quietened down after this would not be incorrect...However, the reality of the matter was that the child was stood there frozen in fear as urine dribbled down their pants.As for the would-be bullies, they screamed and fled in panic.\"Run! Run! The angry lady's turned into a monster! Sh—She's gonna eat us all!\"\"Hey!!! I ain't gonna eat y'all! ...And I ain't no monster, either!\"But it was to no avail.

She intentionally eats all the experimental products, and amid the taste bud explosion that results from the never-before-seen flavors, inspiration flows into her mind.\"Tell you what, Xiangling, that dish rocked!\"Though Xinyan considers this to be the highest praise, Xiangling finds it a little hard to be happy about such ratings."

Xinyan grew to be taller than most girls, and her looks were far from anything that might be considered \"cute.\" Nor was she any good at any of the feminine arts, whether it was cooking, chores, needlework.So, since her childhood was so deeply impacted by such \"prejudices,\" Xinyan understands how terrifying they could be.Yet becoming a rock 'n' roll star has not caused her to give up on these other arts.This is not only because she hates losing, but because she feels that \"giving up because you have no talent\" is itself a prejudiced belief.Not long ago, a fan of Xinyan's named Yun Jin was invited to her place as a guest.But if Xinyan hadn't opened the door herself, Yun Jin would have thought that she had the wrong house.The house was spick and span, the windows were clean, and the home ornaments were hand-made and immaculately arranged.The cooktop was still moist, indicating that someone had been cooking not long before, and there was half-sewn cloth by the bedside that looked much like the decorations Xinyan wore during her performances.Why, this was practically the room of some refined lady of reputable upbringing, with nary any spirit of rock 'n' roll to be found!Xinyan was quite worried that this fan of hers would find the difference between their impression of \"rock 'n' roll\" and this reality too jarring.Unexpectedly, Yun Jin's support and fandom would only grow more intense after this."

After all, such mockery was born of prejudice towards her age.And if prejudice were something so easily overthrown, there would be no value in resisting it, would there?She believes that rock 'n' roll is like a seed. After every performance, some seeds might sprout within the hearts of those adults who listen.When they wake up the next day, perhaps they might receive some inspiration, or perhaps a change of mood will come over them...Even if it only changes their thinking a little bit... Perhaps they might find that the real-life troubles they are facing are nothing but a storm in a teacup.Of course, few people other than her audience and the \"friends of rock\" would credit this to rock 'n' roll.But people do nonetheless say this around the tables after tea.\"Well, having a girl who plays rock 'n' roll is pretty interesting, no?\""

Its internals can also spew flame, all the better for it to self-destruct if it falls into the wrong hands, preventing its misuse...The list of modifications goes on, and they are too numerous to count.This instrument is thus unique, and its sound profile is also special.—Sorry, what?

    "text": "Xinyan was someone who never fit in in Liyue Harbor, and she only found where she belonged when she encountered rock 'n' roll.But because she lived in a land that had no place for rock 'n' roll yet, she needed to be able to attract enough attention.She immersed herself in the world of music, looking for a way to move people's hearts. She broke many an instrument and played till calluses formed on both hands, but still, it was unsatisfactory.\"Who'd want to listen to this racket?\"The rotten-tomato reviews she received were starting to get to her. She wondered if she should quit.Sitting on top of Mt. Tianheng, she looked down over Liyue Harbor. But though the lights lit the streets and alleys of the harbor, they could not light the flame of the spirit of rock 'n' roll.She considered leaving, to go someplace where rock 'n' roll was appreciated. But would this not be running away? Would it not be a betrayal of rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance?No, she would not leave. She would become a \"flame\" that could light Liyue Harbor up.She started experimenting with the use of fire to move people, adding sparks and explosions to her music.But this was no mean feat for an ordinary person.Who knows how many times she must have burnt her fingers or blown her instrument up. But still, she continued to practice every single day on top of Mt. Tianheng.And perhaps it was that the gods themselves had great expectations of this new form of music that would soon grace the seven nations...But regardless, the boiling-hot Vision would be the final stroke of perfection.Xinyan dashed down the mountain and began her very first rock 'n' roll concert in Liyue Harbor.Thus did her musical journey begin, with showers of sparks and explosions keeping time."

At times, the man would admit his fault, promising to never gamble again.<!--\n              -->But other times, a kitchenware-shattering domestic war would break out, in which the victor would invariably be Kinich's father, stronger in body as he was, with his defeated mother left to quietly tend to the crops they grew in their backyard—<!--\n              -->This resilient woman was not adept at fighting, but was an excellent farmer. And just as well, too, for there were three mouths to feed in that house.<!--\n              -->Not long afterward, Kinich's father would go on to lose their house, forcing them to move to the foot of a mountain, far from their tribe.<!--\n              -->This arrangement was not without its benefits, for it did come with a larger plot of land. Here, Kinich learned to plant Grainfruit, twist castor oil plants into rope, mix tapioca flour to make thick noodles, and learn the art of trap-making to hunt for forest boars.<!--\n              -->But the ills were more evident, for any violence here had no hope of neighborly mediation, the injuries he and his mother would suffer contingent only on his father's state of drunkenness.<!--\n              -->One night, his mother snuck out and left without making the slightest noise, leaving her young son behind, perhaps for fear that her husband might pursue her to the ends of the earth otherwise.<!--\n              -->Kinich does not recall if she said goodbye to him, but nonetheless, he ably succeeded her housework, farmwork, hunting-craft, and beatings.<!--\n              -->As he grew, however, Kinich gradually found means of escape. His athleticism proved exceptional, and as he grew faster each day, his father grew less able to catch him.<!--\n              -->Each time he all but flew out the door, the wind would briefly conceal his father's enraged yells, granting him a rare moment of freedom.<!--\n              -->And perhaps fate itself had pity on him, for he was soon to experience true freedom.

His father pursued him, eyes shot through with hangover red, aiming to give him a piece of his mind... But long years of drinking had left the man's body with a shadow of its former strength. As the chase led them past a precipice, he lost his footing by mistake, plummeting off the cliff.<!--\n              -->By the time Kinich had reacted, the man with whom he had lived for many years lay at the bottom of a col, unmoving as a forest boar tired of struggling in a snare. He would never again get up.<!--\n              -->The first thing Kinich felt was a daze, almost like being snow-blind, before a staggering sourness knocked him out of that torpid haze.<!--\n              -->Only by squeezing his eyes shut, scrunching his nose, and breathing deeply, warping and twisting his face in the process, did he manage to hold in the tears.<!--\n              -->After some time, he knew not how long, he picked up his father's grappling hook and dragged the man's stiffened body back home.<!--\n              -->His father had never taught him how to use such equipment, but Kinich had learned just by watching in secret a few times. Now, he blitzed past one tree branch after another, the wind whizzing in his ears.<!--\n              -->On his seventh birthday, the mountains had sent him the gift of freedom — but when he opened the box, he found naught but solitude within."

Every one of our heroes deserves to be remembered, not only for their strength, but also for their spirit of self-sacrifice.\"<!--\n              -->At this moment, Kinich raised his hand from where he sat, furthest beyond the circle. \"Why would they want to sacrifice themselves?\"<!--\n              -->\"There is no particular why or wherefore. That is simply a virtue innate to heroes,\" the Elder replied. \"And what did this virtue get them in return?\" Kinich asked again.<!--\n              -->\"Virtue is a thing beyond price. It cannot be exchanged for anything, for it is a reward from the heavens.\"<!--\n              -->\"A reward?\" Kinich's doubts had not been assuaged. \"What sort of reward, exactly? Fame? Mora?\"<!--\n              -->\"All these, of course, but they were not the key. The key is virtue itself, for it is the basis of noble character, and that is what makes a hero a hero.\"<!--\n              -->The old scholar closed his book and gave Kinich an earnest look, though the boy had not particularly understood this statement. Instead, he was thinking back on the past—<!--\n              -->The mountains told him that the forest boar was the noblest of things, for it could fill his stomach. The next noblest was water, for without it, humans would die of thirst.<!--\n              -->But neither of these were his birthright, and that made them precious. Thus, when he gave them up, he would seek something in return.<!--\n              -->Mora was the \"something\" he preferred best, for it could be exchanged for many other things.<!--\n              -->And so he told Elder Leik, \"If I become a hero, I want to be rewarded with Mora.\"<!--\n              -->How the other children laughed then, the boy who had mocked Kinich foremost amongst them. \"Why don't you go back and swing in your trees then, selfish mud monkey?\"<!--\n              -->But his little gang was not satisfied with just this. Standing up, they squeezed Kinich out the door. Though Elder Leik tried to stop them, Kinich took the opportunity to leave all the same. He felt no need to stay there any longer, for his keen mind had caught onto a certain truth—<!--\n              -->These noisy brats in the Lodge were just that — brats. As they gathered to heap praise upon the heroes, it must have seemed to them that they had become the companions of those heroes, sharing in their nobility. But such false glory would not teach them how to fill their tummies. Once school was over, every single one of them would have to return home and be fed by their mothers.<!--\n              -->Kinich could have taught them a lesson right there, too. Laid a couple out for half a month or so, just to let them know how far they were from being heroes.<!--\n              -->But what use was there in giving out free life lessons... emphasis on \"free\"?<!--\n              -->Still, this class was not an entirely fruitless endeavor. If nothing else, he now had some answers to his doubts.<!--\n              -->He knew what he must do in the future. Become a hero — for the Mora, that is."

Not long after he graduated from the Learning Lodge, he would seek Elder Leik out on his own to suggest how he might gain this strength.<!--\n              -->To secure the Elder's approval, he even brought all he owned, hoping that it might constitute a worthy price:<!--\n              -->Grappling hooks and trap-making equipment, freshly-harvested castor beans, two large pots of tapioca flour, a bag of Grainfruit seeds, a freshly-slaughtered forest boar, and a small amount of Mora.<!--\n              -->The Elder laughed and rejected Kinich's offer of remuneration, on one condition, that Kinich learn what it truly meant to be a hero on his journey.<!--\n              -->In truth, the Elder had always cherished high hopes for the boy, for he could see a reflection of the ancient heroes within him.<!--\n              -->At the same time, he believed that Kinich required proper guidance, for should he set out on the wrong path, he could do far greater damage than your average villain. Thus, a new trade was agreed upon.<!--\n              -->In this way, Kinich would live alongside Elder Leik in the mountains and forests for many years.<!--\n              -->And even as the Elder taught Kinich about the history of Natlan and the heroes of its various tribes, he would also recommend many notables to the lad.<!--\n              -->A fletcher who made special arrowheads, a witch doctor specializing in Saurian poisons, an old hunter skilled in the use of ropes and grappling hooks, an expert in escape and evasion from dire situations...<!--\n              -->Kinich would never reject such expertise, and learned much from them day and night, but this alone did not satisfy him, and on designated rest days, he would return to the mountains to hone his combat skills.<!--\n              -->Without a formal teacher in this regard, he would imitate the motions of wild animals as they hunted. Some were agile, others cunning, and others fierce, and so he took their strengths and incorporated them into his own unique martial arts.<!--\n              -->As his abilities grew, Elder Leik would also guide Kinich to take on more duties within the tribe, beginning with courier work.<!--\n              -->Kinich proved skilled at this beyond even many adults, doing all that they could in half the time.<!--\n              -->With his skills, it was no surprise that people would gradually come to him, offering payment in exchange for more dangerous services, including the slaying of powerful Saurians.<!--\n              -->The Elder initially assumed that Kinich might come to ask his opinion, but not once did this happen.<!--\n              -->In this regard, the young man was like a veteran of over ten years, always able to judge the merits of any commission and negotiate suitable payment.<!--\n              -->And when there was falsehood or concealment involved in such commissions, Kinich would forcefully weigh the cost upon the scales of his heart and adjust the price accordingly, regardless of whether the other party might refuse.<!--\n              -->Such behavior, of course, led to some criticism, and there were important folk even within the tribe who felt that Kinich did not give his work enough care.<!--\n              -->But the young man would never explain himself, simply continuing to set the prices he saw fit for each assignment he was given.<!--\n              -->Even Elder Trinidad, who had charge over ritual matters, took issue with this at one point, and sought to summon the lad for questioning. However, Elder Leik stopped him.<!--\n              -->\"Come now, no need for all this fuss. The lad knows what he's doing.\"<!--\n              -->\"It's preposterous! The Scions of the Canopy have never called any such person a hero!\"<!--\n              -->\"And that's where you're mistaken. He has never been a Scion of the Canopy. He is a scion of the mountains — the only sort of hero he will become is the sort he wishes to be.\""

For example, she has been able to increase the nectar output of Sweet Flowers by 70% by irrigating them with a special potion. She has also developed a special spray that allows Sunsettias to maintain their freshness for a whole month after being plucked from the branch.Even people who were initially suspicious of her research inclinations have come to acknowledge her exceptional talents in the field of alchemy after seeing such results.However, she merely considers these to be incidental steps on the path to a successful experiment, rather than the success itself. Her true aim is much more ambitious than this.It's a secret, and is also her little dream."

    "text": "Bio-alchemy explores numerous lines of inquiry, all of which stem from Sucrose's questions about living things in the world. These questions, in turn, are born out of her insatiable curiosity, a faculty that is far more developed in her than it is in most.For instance, Sucrose's curiosity was once drawn to the sweet flower, accepted by most people as simply being a source of sugar.She wondered: Although sweetness is clearly the most readily identifiable feature of this plant, should that be grounds for limiting its application as we have tended to do? Does it not merit further study?So, after a careful study of the various features of sweet flowers, she devised thirty-something distinct rearing plans along with numerous control groups to account for temperature and other environmental conditions.And yet, her experiment still underestimated just how many variations were possible. After the experiment began, Sucrose found herself with more questions rather than fewer, and the novel discoveries that her experiment yielded gave her inspiration for further research.Sucrose is incapable of leaving a question unattended to — it makes her restless, even guilty, to ignore it. Spurred on by this quirk of her temperament, her rearing plans grew in number to almost three hundred.The result was a whole new series of sweet flower strains: Some with thrice the number of flowers, some with heads five or six times the normal size that could even float in the wind, and some even producing a sweet-tasting fruit.Months of experimentation later, Sucrose had finally answered every last one of her questions pertaining to sweet flowers. As she finished writing up her research notes, she let out a long sigh of relief.Though she was physically and mentally exhausted, the sight of stack after stack of her bio-alchemical research volumes stretching around three walls of the room gave her a deep sense of joy and satisfaction."

    "text": "To the people around her, Sucrose comes across as a quiet, introverted alchemist with little interest in the lives of others.In fact, the truth is quite the opposite: Sucrose is fascinated by absolutely everything that exists in the world. The only thing is, she finds the discipline of social interaction to be far more difficult to master than that of alchemy.In alchemy, the process of trial-and-error coupled with a determination to get to the truth is sufficient to bring you to your answer eventually. But with interpersonal relationships, there is the added complication of having to factor in manners, moods, and other unquantifiable variables. To make things worse, there seems to be no room for an approach that relies heavily on making errors.Hence, Sucrose decided to avoid such variables at all costs and stick to her familiar methods in satisfying her curiosity.For instance, Sucrose had always been curious about whether she and Cat's Tail bartender Diona, both of whom have animal ears, had any shared ancestry.In fact, this was not a private matter, and most people would simply ask the question. But Sucrose was concerned that it would be a sensitive topic — she, for one, did not like people drawing attention to her ears.So, she resorted to the method she knew best: observation.For one whole month, Diona constantly had an unnerving sense that someone was secretly watching her. She assumed that one of the tavern patrons was stalking her, and was none too happy about it.\"Similar genome, but ultimately different ancestry. Cat connection merits further study. Note: Unable to obtain bone sample thus far.\"This is the conclusion that Sucrose has jotted down in her notebook based on her findings so far.Bio-alchemy aside, Sucrose made one further discovery from this episode.That is to say, judging by the pair of cat-ear spectacles she made for herself after the event, it would appear that she has finally come to comprehend a certain uniquely feline variety of cuteness. She is too shy to wear them in public, however, and only puts them on when alone in her room."

Sorry, I... I'd like, um, the freshest, best-quality b—bones you've got... Yep, the ones with the blood and meat still on.\"People found her behavior utterly unusual at first, but once they had gotten used to it, they were eager to oblige, even putting the rarest bones aside for her in advance.This was a major bonus for her. Not only was she able to acquire an ample supply of the usual chicken and boar bones, but she also got her hands on a complete lizard skeleton and even a chunk of hilichurl leg bone still bearing fresh blood.Her eyes would light up with excitement at the sight of these strange and rare bones. She would thank Katheryne of the Adventurers' Guild profusely, bowing to her over and over.As well as going some way towards satisfying Sucrose's curiosity, she also found new inspiration from piecing new bones togetherMore importantly, collecting skeletons was her hobby, and she was crazy about it.One day, Sucrose happened to overhear a mother attempting to discipline her child:\"If you don't do as your told, the scary old lady with the cloth sack over her back will come to your door, go into your room, pick out every bone from your body, and take them away!\"Sucrose's curiosity compelled her to investigate further. It turned out that this was nothing more than a ghost story used by mothers to shock their children into compliance, and that it had existed long before Sucrose was even born.She breathed a sigh of relief when she found out the truth.Soon after this, people noticed that Sucrose had switched her cloth sack for a leather one. Perhaps she did this just because she was shy. Or perhaps it was to avoid arousing suspicion..."

Nothing new to report there. All of these were foods and beverages that she had previously researched, after all.Next, she thought, how about a little rest and relaxation in the sun with a good book? Again, nothing new to report: plenty of research shows this to be one of the most effective means of relaxation. There wasn't a book that she hadn't already read, and there wasn't a query that she hadn't already highlighted, looked into, and later annotated for clarification.So then she did some household chores: laundry, dusting, tidying. Check. Once again — nothing new to report. There was nothing to dispute about the fact that a clean and tidy environment is conducive to mental well-being.Half a day in, and Sucrose had not had the occasion to ask \"why\" or \"how\" even once.She was bored, restless, and angsty, and she could not calm herself down.She was desperate to throw herself at a research problem. It didn't matter what it was: She would have happily researched the potted plants on the terrace, even if nothing came of it. Anything just to pass the time.But wherever she looked — the Lamp Grass to her left, the Sweet Flower in front of her, or the Cecilia to her right — all she found were things that she had previously researched in exhaustive detail.Finally, she gave up and forced herself to go to sleep. The next day, she reported to the laboratory first thing in the morning.\"All day long, you have nothing to research, and nothing to question. That's not rest, it's torture!\""

The promise that they had once made to reunite some day in the future no longer meant anything.Sucrose felt lonelier then than she ever had felt before in her whole life. They hadn't even set eyes on paradise yet, and already her friends were gone...Well. Even if they were destined to never meet again, Sucrose was desperate to honor their past friendship in some way. That was when she discovered the existence of alchemy from a book that she was reading.Sucrose realized: Though she had never had the chance to find the entrance to that wondrous place, she now had the opportunity to be the creator of her own paradise.Thus began her study of bio-alchemy, and she poured all of her curiosity and passion into it.Still, she has never once mentioned the story of paradise and her bygone friendships to anyone else.Perhaps one day, when that place she first learned of in a children's storybook finally becomes a reality in the real world, her friends will return."

Yes, this meant the names ended up being much longer, but, but......But anyway, Sucrose is the creator of this paradise, so why shouldn't she get to name things any way she wants to?"

Sucrose rushed to the cauldron, anxious to see what new transmutation had occurred this time; in her excitement, she even burned both of her hands on the lip of the cauldron.Much to her disappointment, however, the Dandelion Seeds had once again burned to a crisp. But there was something new there, too: lying there amidst the black Dandelion Seeds was a Vision.And yet, rather than pouring out the liquid and taking her Vision, she first thought for a moment and then lit the fire up again to continue simmering the contents of the cauldron.She was curious to know what further reactions might occur between Dandelion Seeds and Visions.Sadly, the experiment ended in failure after three hours of constant simmering.Still, there was no denying that she had reaped a great reward from this experiment, for the elemental energy provided by her Vision would become her single greatest asset in her future bio-alchemical endeavors."

Collei, however, seems to have only barely reached the foot of the mountain of knowledge.<!--\n              -->When she first arrived in Gandharva Ville, even the outspoken Tighnari showed obvious hesitation, making repeated inquiries with the General Mahamatra if she had walked through the wrong door, since he had yet to make any plans to teach preschool level courses.<!--\n              -->Still, after several twists and turns, Collei did finally become a trainee. To facilitate her learning of words, Tighnari gathered a wide assortment of books and documents, in the hope that Collei would soon master enough words through extensive reading.<!--\n              -->Apart from the literacy encyclopedias for children and the mandatory-reading academic papers that made her head swell, Collei can most often be found reading fairy tale picture books from Mondstadt.<!--\n              -->The logic is simple: those books tend to have fewer words and more pictures. Even if you do not know the words, chances are that you can still guess their meaning by looking at the illustrations.<!--\n              -->However, reading only children's books hardly sufficed to keep up with her curriculum. Once she had picked up slightly more words, she immediately started to look for new extracurricular reading materials.<!--\n              -->According to some travelers who had passed through Avidya Forest, there was a type of book in Inazuma known as the \"light novel,\" which was easier to read than academic papers, and with fewer illustrations than picture books. To Collei, that sounded like the exact type of book she needed.<!--\n              -->More importantly, the plots of these \"light novels\" were often so incredibly riveting that as soon as they got a copy, many readers just had to finish reading it in one go, even if they had to stay up all night.<!--\n              -->That definitely sounded tempting to Collei, since she had to force herself, more often than not, to stay awake long enough to finish her readings.<!--\n              -->One day after her forest patrol, Collei excitedly ran back to her dormitory with the newest volume of \"Onibudou.\" She was so ready to pull an all-nighter reading the light novel — and as it turned out, she indeed stayed awake that night.<!--\n              -->\"My sealed power!\" \"The lonesome avenger!\" \"You'd be wise to stay away from me!\" \"I shall never witness the grace of the gods!\"...<!--\n              -->—Covering her head with the quilt, Collei tossed and turned upon her mattress the entire night.

Collei knew that look.<!--\n              -->The family had been traveling with a caravan to cross the river valley. As they were camping and resting, her playful daughter had run off, straying into the deep forest. As soon as the caravan noticed that the child was missing, they tried their best searching for her, but it was all in vain.<!--\n              -->In desperation, the mother had to return to Gandharva Ville to look for help.<!--\n              -->Recently, Tighnari had been attending meetings in the city with other Forest Rangers, and the situation before her was critical — Collei could not wait for any of them to return.

He was well aware that Collei was not capable of doing all this — unless she had wielded power that should not be unleashed.<!--\n              -->It was like drinking poison to quench thirst, and it would surely aggravate Collei's condition. He must contact the General Mahamatra right away...<!--\n              -->Tighnari's footsteps awakened Collei.

Furthermore, when selecting recruits, the Special Patrol will even accept the descendants of criminals whose households had been stripped of all honor...<!--\n              -->For the sake of quickly solving the most heinous of cases, the Maison Gardiennage is willing to overlook all those issues, displaying great forbearance towards Chevreuse and the Special Patrol. But what they simply cannot abide is how Chevreuse is willing to invite serious felons to participate in cases she is handling as \"special consultants.\"<!--\n              -->Though Chevreuse stridently maintains that this is purely to catch vicious criminals as soon as possible, many colleagues still believe that relying on lawbreakers to help arrest lawbreakers is an insult to both the laws of Fontaine and those who enforce them. Should such humiliations continue, what dignity would remain for the Maison Gardiennage and the law itself?<!--\n              -->Faced with such pointed questions, Chevreuse always gives the same simple response:<!--\n              -->\"The greatest insult to the law is a criminal roaming free and unpunished.\"<!--\n              -->\"And as for the 'dignity' of the Maison Gardiennage, it isn't even worthy of comparison with the safety of the Court of Fontaine.\"<!--\n              -->This, too, is one of her father's teachings."

    "text": "\"Monsieur Donatello is an upstanding officer of the law.\"<!--\n              -->When Chevreuse discusses her father with others, she always offers this simple, curt evaluation. This is also one of the only two impressions she has of her father from her childhood.<!--\n              -->Donatello was always busy, leaving hurriedly in the mornings and returning exhausted at night before giving Chevreuse and her mother a hug, gently apologizing for making them wait so long. Sometimes he would return exceptionally late, bringing his daughter sweet treats. Alas, having long since already brushed her teeth, it was also too late for her to have any more sugar.<!--\n              -->Such gifts were a rare treat, and yet their luster would fade by morning, and so Chevreuse's mother would allow little Chevreuse to lick a bit of cream off before sending said dessert to her father's bedroom along with a cup of coffee.<!--\n              -->At this time, her father would always be facing a wall covered in pictures and thumbtacks, at times staring blankly at it, at others pacing in circles, smoking, tousling his hair, and sometimes raising his fists in sudden triumph, before slowly lowering them and helplessly pounding the table— Chevreuse bore silent witness to all this, peeping in from behind the door.<!--\n              -->Sometimes, when she ran into her father on the street, she would excitedly wave, but at most he would return a slight smile before throwing himself back into his myriad tasks.<!--\n              -->\"He's an upright, good man.\"<!--\n              -->Her mother, neighbors, his colleagues, and even the kids next door all praised her father thusly.<!--\n              -->But one day, those colleagues who were always praising her father as an upstanding man suddenly came knocking at her door.<!--\n              -->Her mother was at a complete loss as she watched them come and go from her home. Though Chevreuse stayed in her room, from the commotion outside her door, she had already vaguely guessed that her father had become a \"sinner\" like those he had once pursued, and was at that moment awaiting sentencing, and might even be banished to the Fortress of Meropide.<!--\n              -->\"Did Papa... do something wrong?\"<!--\n              -->This was the question she asked the strange adults beside her.

Her father's colleagues often came by in plainclothes, bringing all kinds of gifts with them. In addition to their presents, they brought news as well. They told her mother of the appeal they were all working so hard on — not just the Gardes and the members of the Special Patrol, but even several Gestionnaires who oft worked with them — and how despite the fact Donatello had broken the law was indisputable and established fact, and legally speaking his sentence could not be commuted or shortened, they at least could ensure he didn't need to endure further castigation. It was all of scant comfort to her mother, whose worries did not subside.<!--\n              -->To take care of her mother, Chevreuse didn't hesitate to take up burdens that one as young as she should never have had to shoulder, stepping into the dark currents that swirled through the Fleuve Cendre.<!--\n              -->Perhaps it was because the residents of the Fleuve Cendre had heard tell of or been on the receiving end of her upright father's care that so many helping hands were extended to her. A well-meaning shop owner gave her a job, and the couple next door often took care of her infirm mother.<!--\n              -->And when the children of the Fleuve Cendre heard that the child of a Garde had come to live among them, they flocked to her like plaintiffs and defendants, seeking her arbitration on all manner of quarrels and disputes.<!--\n              -->\"Chevreuse! You gotta uphold justice, y'know!\"<!--\n              -->So cried the children with one voice, before laughing as one. They did not truly intend to allow Chevreuse to determine who was at fault, but rather saw it all as merely another game.<!--\n              -->Yet the next day, Chevreuse brought a thick stack of legal materials when she went to see them, along with a notebook newly opened to the first page, and began speaking to the chortling children in a tone most serious.<!--\n              -->\"Very well. Let both sides present their evidence.\"<!--\n              -->And from that day forward, the Fleuve Cendre had one more enforcer of the law — the littlest one around. But unlike the law enforcement officers aboveground, all judgments rendered by Chevreuse were executed under her personal supervision.<!--\n              -->There in the sewers, she learned many ways to ensure that \"justice\" would be upheld."

A child of a sinner, unable to work for the Maison Gardiennage, and thus seeking to fight crime as a member of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol...<!--\n              -->As the Captain of the Special Patrol was hearing her case, Chevreuse found herself explaining herself and reading her statement over and over. Having finished serving his sentence, her father Donatello was now serving in the Special Patrol. He had pored over her statement, and it had nary a single mistake or blemish.<!--\n              -->Though it had been a long time since he was ousted from his former post, Donatello still understood the Maison Gardiennage's thinking. If Chevreuse was to take up the post of Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol without issue, she would need to provide the good folks at the Maison Gardiennage with a sufficiently \"decent\" statement, such that they might clearly and firmly — yet with a bit of wiggle room — announce her appointment.<!--\n              -->Chevreuse was no longer a child. She knew full well that her father had leaked classified intelligence regarding a major case to utilize the resulting interest from the press to assist in investigating that criminal. After her family moved to the Fleuve Cendre, the Gardes who visited — ranking officers among them — had surreptitiously provided aid, so their situation could not be considered too dire. Furthermore, the officers and members of the Special Patrol had made preparations ahead of time for Chevreuse to learn from them in the field, learning all about the relevant work in advance...<!--\n              -->But saying all of that would be of no help to Chevreuse in taking over as Captain.<!--\n              -->Though Donatello was still uneasy about his daughter following in his footsteps, she had completed all the training he had prepared for her. Chevreuse had given it her all, passing even those trials designed expressly to frustrate and vex her.<!--\n              -->As Chevreuse plunged forward in the bone-chillingly freezing winter seas, it seemed to take every last ounce of Donatello's willpower to stand still and watch instead of running forth to cradle her in his embrace. As Chevreuse swam back to his side, trembling and shivering, Donatello knew that his daughter was stronger than he was, and even more suited to uphold \"justice.\"<!--\n              -->But today, let all of that be washed away into eternal silence amid the waters of the Fleuve Cendre.<!--\n              -->For this father and daughter who long ago had swum together in the icy winter seas, it was now time to take a step forward.<!--\n              -->\"...My father violated Gardes regulations.

To preserve the law's standing, it is better not to discuss such things.<!--\n              -->But those close to Chevreuse know that this Vision is much more akin to a heavy burden for her.<!--\n              -->After Chevreuse joined the Special Patrol, she used her extraordinary talent and perseverance to complete all kinds of internal training programs, memorizing every rule, regulation, and standard for Special Patrol operations along with the related statutes. Without question, she was first in her class, and her pursuit of \"justice\" was widely admired by other members.<!--\n              -->But the officer in charge of them, Vice Captain Grizzetti, disagreed, and he never selected Chevreuse for field missions. Other members could only guess why: Perhaps it was to protect her? After all, he was once close with her father Donatello, and had taken care of her. They were so close that Chevreuse was said to call him \"Uncle Grizzetti.\" Or maybe he was planning to groom her to take on some particularly important job?<!--\n              -->Chevreuse didn't think about such complicated matters. After the sixth time she was excluded from a mission, she could bear it no longer and finally asked the usually amiable Uncle Grizzetti why he never chose her for fieldwork.<!--\n              -->\"You're not ready.\"<!--\n              -->Came the reply.<!--\n              -->\"Fix your conception of justice first, Chevreuse.

This is where the voice of justice must ring true.\"<!--\n              -->At the time, Chevreuse had not yet grasped this, nor did she even know just when she would be ready.

With no choice but to call on Chevreuse, he repeatedly warned her to stay close, follow orders, and not act without permission. And then it was time to move out, and the various members filed out into the howling tempest to close off every possible route the gang of criminals could take.<!--\n              -->Chevreuse and Grizzetti concealed themselves behind some shrubbery, but the criminals did not appear. Just as the two of them began to think their intelligence was mistaken and were preparing to withdraw quietly, a shot rang out from a hidden position, and Grizzetti was struck. Chevreuse counterattacked nearly instantly, using the muzzle flash in the darkness to sight the criminal's position before hitting them with a single precise bullet. But Uncle Grizzetti had already sunk into eternal silence.<!--\n              -->Now, only Chevreuse and the killer remained. The howling wind and torrential downpour would conceal the sound of another gunshot, and the Special Patrol...

Perhaps this was what it meant to be \"ready\" to become a member of the Special Patrol.<!--\n              -->\"This is the Court of Fontaine Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. You are under arrest.\"<!--\n              -->No sooner had she finished speaking than the killer began to hobble away, seeking to flee without the slightest hesitation. With the crack of a musket, the man was struck squarely in his right leg. He cried out in agony, cursing as he rolled on the ground, finally coming to a stop before the feet of the other Patrol members who had rushed over.<!--\n              -->The \"justice\" of the law is meted out by the courts, but as for Chevreuse's own personal justice, that is carried out by her alone.<!--\n              -->As Chevreuse finally completely lowered her musket, she had yet to notice a Vision was now hanging from the stock.<!--\n              -->In the lashing wind and rain, its glow was not readily apparent, much like justice yet to be revealed — pale and dark."

    "text": "Komaniya Express, the famous delivery company in Inazuma, has a very special employee working under them. At a glance, she resembles an adorably dressed teenage girl with two tails swaying behind her. Though she treats each of her customers with kindness and generosity, secretly she sometimes takes to running quietly across rooftops to ensure none of her deliveries arrive late...\nThough her obvious nature as a youkai drew more than few comments at first, as Kirara introduced herself with honesty and clarity time and time again while conducting her tasks with dutifulness and effectiveness, people not only dropped all lingering misgivings but even grew grateful for her presence. \"Safe and punctual,\" \"service assured,\" \"vivacious and adorable\"... These three phrases are words most commonly used to describe Kirara on the feedback board. Word is that if you give her a five-star rating or offer her some snacks, you might even see Kirara's face brighten with gratitude as her tails whirl with building joy.\nTo Kirara, her job is as precious as any jewel. She treasures everything about human society and is always overjoyed to behold the smiling faces of her customers. Thus, she gives her all to offer the best service she can for everyone she caters to. After all, if she finds herself fired by the company, all she can do is return being a youkai in the mountains.\nThankfully, her boss at Komaniya Express had never even considered the idea of releasing her. Contrarily, they privately asked Kirara if she wanted higher pay and to transition into comparatively less effortful secretarial work, but Kirara rejected their offer with haste. She didn't have the heart to tell her boss that, to her, every time she leaves to make a delivery, it feels like she's getting to enjoy an outing at the public's expense!"

But the same people who tell you this will also warn you that this nekomata isn't some weak little thing you can pick on. If you have designs on packages that don't belong to you or get carried away and try to touch her tails...

    "text": "Kirara's earliest memories are of wandering the wilds of Inazuma.<!--\n              -->Back then, she was a nameless kitten with but one tail, and woke every morning with an empty, growling stomach. After a stretch, a yawn, and a single \"meow\" as though to bellyache about her circumstances, she would begin to hunt for breakfast. The menu often included finches that had let down their guard, or overly curious young fish too near the shore.<!--\n              -->Whenever she encountered adventurers out in the wilderness, she would lie down at a safe distance and watch intently as they fished out all kinds of marvelous instruments from their packs. Fwoosh! Suddenly there was a fire roaring. Bong! A strange cauldron was set over the fire. And then, with a bubbling sound, an intoxicating scent would occasionally waft over on the breeze...<!--\n              -->Observing this process with wide eyes, to her it was as if she had witnessed magic. Thus a yearning for human society began to flutter about in her chest, as though a butterfly had flown into her heart.<!--\n              -->During a frigid winter night with the biting winds howling, Kirara, still a small kitten, was frozen to the point of being unable to feel her tail.<!--\n              -->\"Gotta find a warm place to hide. Even a hollow in a tree will do...\" She thought to herself. But when she was able to look up, she saw a cluster of warm lights flickering not too far away...<!--\n              -->This was the first time Kirara entered a human home, and while she was curious about everything around her, she was also frightened. The owner of the house seemed not to notice the kitten that had found its way into her home, but Kirara paid little notice. She found a small square box near the entryway into which she snugly fit, and into it did she sit, falling asleep almost immediately.<!--\n              -->\"I'll just rest the night, just one night...\" were her last thoughts before dreams took her...<!--\n              -->Yet when she awoke, she found a warm fire crackled away next to her, and beside it was a fragrant bowl of nekomanma. Directly across from her was an old lady in the middle of knitting a woolen sweater. The old lady seemed to be trying to say something, as though encouraging her to eat. With her tail down and guard raised, she cautiously took a bite of that aromatic nekomanma in front of her that she was so curious about...<!--\n              -->It was the most delicious thing she had ever eaten, to the point she began to doubt whether or not she was still dreaming!<!--\n              -->And so, she stayed in that cozy little home for one winter after another, and heard story after story from that kind old woman...<!--\n              -->On occasion, when Kirara thinks back to that first night, she'll cock her head and ask herself:<!--\n              -->\"Strange... what was I thinking about before I fell asleep again...?\""

There is always something she's never seen before, waiting to be discovered.<!--\n              -->When she first became a nekomata, she used her youkai powers to enter Inazuma City in a human form. She eagerly explored every nook and cranny in the city, and not even the roof of the Almighty Shogun's Tenshukaku was immune from her curiosity. This is the reason that the Tenryou Commission is one of the addresses she is most familiar with.<!--\n              -->Though the Tenryou Commission taught her rules like \"don't climb on other people's roofs\" and \"don't eat the ornamental koi\", then she learned \"how to be a good youkai in human society\" from none other than the Lady Kitsune of the Grand Narukami Shrine. Kirara has caught the eye of \"the greatest and coolest youkai,\" as she calls her, and Yae Miko, for her part, has been willing to impart all her experience upon her lively and interesting junior. Upon learning that Kirara felt the streets and alleys of Inazuma City were priceless treasures, Miko recommended that she seek employment at Komaniya Express.<!--\n              -->\"If you want to blend into human society, then you must work like an ordinary human.

Lately, her tail was always itchy and restless, and no matter how much she licked it, it was never enough to calm it.<!--\n              -->\"Strange, Granny left this morning, she's been gone way too long...\" she quietly mewed to herself.<!--\n              -->The final lingering ember became darkened ash, and even the residual warmth it had provided was snuffed out.

Kirara did not think about just how high she had climbed. Instead, stories of youkai and humans raced across her mind.

The child, deathly ill, was miraculously healed by those spring waters.Many people came to catch a glimpse of these blessed waters, and built a settlement around it, and left it not thereafter. Over time, this gave rise to the small town known as Springvale.Nowadays, few are left who believe that this is any more than a mere legend, and some even dismiss it as myth-making for tourism's sake.Only little Diona believed in the existence of the spring fairy, and on nights when her father was in a deep stuporous sleep, she would speak to the moon reflected in the spring water's surface.These were her earnest feelings, innocent and wonderful — feelings worth answering.That was what the spring fairy believed.So, Diona would make a curious friend, a companion whom she could bare her feelings to and sometimes assuage her loneliness.On the night of Diona's seventh birthday, as the moonlight reflected off the spring and upon her face, she heard the soft voice of the spring fairy.\"I will bless you, daughter of hunters, for your days ahead, and as a farewell. May your cup always run over with the sweet wine of celebration. May it always be refreshing as springs of ever-melting snow.\"From that day on, the spring fairy would never appear before Diona again, and she left those memories behind, consigning them to her childhood dreams.Till today, she has yet to realize that her troublesome constitution has anything at all to do with that dream."

He simply brought a new one back the very next day.When Diona went to Cat's Tail to try out for the role of bartender, Margaret noticed how the cocktail shaker Diona had with her looked wholly unsuited for her style.Ever skilled with handicraft, Margaret would give Diona a cocktail shaker equipped with a lovely cat's tail as an induction gift.\"Now, this suits you far better,\" Margaret said with a satisfied nod."

This title may sound very impressive, but it's really because the Akademiya has a culture of using official titles to inflate one's ego.\nThe role of a scribe may seem prestigious, but the truth is, a scribe does not have to be present at all major meetings, nor does he participate in core decision-making. The scribe is simply responsible for classifying and archiving important documents, and his presence is not required at all times. It is for these exact reasons that in Sumeru, where books and manuscript documents were once managed as a resource, the scribe is one of the people in the entire Akademiya who is in the know about various matters. In fact, one can say that this position is rather similar to that of the Grand Conservator. After all, the person who manages the various texts is the one who has privileged access to profound wisdom.\nAlhaitham, the current scribe of the Sumeru Akademiya checks all the boxes above. Not many people know who he is, but he knows a lot of information that is unknown to everyone. He does not attend any non-essential meeting, and when he does, he only records key points, jotting down other minute details based on his mood. People don't often pay attention to him, let alone know how much detail this scribe can detect in a simple meeting.\nA capable person who keeps a low profile for too long is often perceived as someone with a mysterious identity and ulterior purposes. Alhaitham himself is a powerful rebuttal to all these cliché views: he is a brilliant man, but he is only an ordinary employee of the Akademiya, with a stable job and a cushy house in Sumeru, leading a carefree and comfortable life."

    "text": "The title of a \"scribe\" may sound impressive to most Akademiya students, but this fancy name is just a product of the Akademiya's culture to use unnecessarily high-flown titles.<!--\n              -->In truth, the scribe does not have to be present at all major meetings, nor does he participate in core decision-making. The scribe is simply responsible for classifying and archiving important documents. However, in Sumeru, where books and manuscript documents were once managed as a resource, the scribe is one of the most \"in-the-know\" people in the entire Akademiya. One can say that this position is rather similar to that of the Grand Conservator — after all, the person who manages texts will have privileged access to profound wisdom.<!--\n              -->As the current scribe of the Sumeru Akademiya, Alhaitham acts in perfect compliance with his role: He does not attend any non-essential meetings, and when he is required to be present, he only records key points, jotting down other minute details based on his mood. If the meeting does not affect his personal interests or fails to pique his curiosity, he will not be bothered to give any comments. He does make comments, however, when someone has come up with something offensively foolish — and one should expect these comments to be more blunt than necessary.<!--\n              -->Such is Alhaitham's life philosophy: Whenever the need for his judgment arises, one must be ready to accept any means and privileges he might require to make that judgment. Fortunately for everyone, Alhaitham notes that he is too lazy to possess too many ambitions.<!--\n              -->All scholars seek knowledge and the truth. Some do so for fame, while others, for ambition. And some others enjoy conquering knowledge and the truth, transcending them, and savoring the sense of superiority in the process. Alhaitham isn't any one of them. He is only driven by what intrigues him. He believes that many scholars have already become lost in their pursuits, taking the truth as a tool or even a shortcut to self-realization.<!--\n              -->However, whether one seeks it or not, the truth is always there, hanging high above the sky like an illuminating star. It is not the end of a trip or the destination of a match. It is and shall remain constant, regardless of human existence. Also, human pursuits will not simply end after certain knowledge has been acquired — though people never doubt that they can claim the fruit with joy and are prepared to sacrifice everything for it, their desire for knowledge will keep them going.<!--\n              -->Those who fail to see through the truth set themselves on an endless path, while those with clear minds will say: The truth did not come into being to serve anyone, and whoever is unable to harness their desire for knowledge will be destroyed by it. Such is the rule of the Nation of Wisdom. Of course, if you want to blend in, you are welcome to fake such a posture."

    "text": "To the people of Sumeru, those who played a part in the operation to save Lesser Lord Kusanali are deemed to be heroes. However, a great many who make such compliments don't really know the full story. They simply repeat a fragment of a tale that they find inspiring. As one of the protagonists in their stories, Alhaitham has no opinion whatsoever about being a \"hero,\" nor does he believe that these stories are worth talking about.<!--\n              -->Meanwhile, Alhaitham has declined the Akademiya's offer to become the Grand Sage multiple times. But given the chaos in Sumeru, Alhaitham eventually agreed to serve as Acting Grand Sage temporarily.<!--\n              -->It already defied common logic for someone to refuse the titles of Sage and Grand Sage, and yet Alhaitham went further still, resigning and returning to his humble role as Scribe at the agreed-upon time instead of clinging to power.<!--\n              -->If he did manage to gain anything from it at all, it was the financial benefits: His salary stayed the same after his resignation, not to mention the several high-quality research projects that he was able to complete on his own. There is no doubt, then, that he will lead a well-off life. In addition, his interpersonal relationships have also improved, as he has more or less befriended the other participants in the archon-saving operation — they have gotten close to the point where Alhaitham might greet these people with a nod or two when he sees them.<!--\n              -->Sometimes, Lesser Lord Kusanali will also invite Alhaitham to the Sanctuary of Surasthana to discuss various matters. He has met many people there: the General Mahamatra Cyno, the mercenary Dehya, and Nilou, star of the Zubayr Theater. Nilou even once asked him: \"How did you manage to come up with such a bold plan? When I think back on it, we were all quite lucky to not get hurt...\"<!--\n              -->Nilou hesitated before she continued, and Alhaitham understood her confusion, for anyone would have wondered how he could have stayed unscathed despite the influence of the Divine Knowledge Capsule. But in Alhaitham's eyes, he was never in danger, for he had never used any capsules.<!--\n              -->As for how he had managed to do that, it was all thanks to his role as the scribe. As a scholar lucky enough to have read the Akasha's system manual, he had studied the headset and Canned Knowledge, such that he knew how to alter the status signal of the Akasha. He had even once thought of reversing the holographic shield of the Akasha Terminal and projecting it to the back of his head to offer protection from attacks on that front.<!--\n              -->It has been proven that a plan lays the foundation for everything, and that prior research lays the foundation for a plan. Alhaitham, who had no interest in boasting about how he remained unscathed, answered Nilou's question with another: \"As far as I know, Cyno and Dehya are also curious about this, yet you are the only one who has raised this question. Were they just too shy to ask me themselves?\""

    "text": "Alhaitham seldom discusses personalities or dispositions with others. He believes that the prevalent theories about them are wrong. Suppose someone insists that one's character has nothing to do with their abilities and opinions, the person with such a view will find themselves unable to judge any aspect of another person. A smart person will often hold different attitudes towards a foolish person and another smart person, and the foolish often think differently when facing success and failure. People's views on Alhaitham are proof of this point — given his superb talents and egocentric personality, no one wants to get too close to him, but still, they see him as an outstanding scholar.<!--\n              -->This is exactly the public image Alhaitham desires. Many scholars are rigid and inflexible, but Alhaitham is not one of them. As a matter of fact, his occasional sarcasm in part reflects his philosophy. Society (or the collective) relies on rules to regulate individuals, and language is one of these regulative tools. Turning language against its original design serves to challenge unreasonable rules, and one can thus stay out of trouble.<!--\n              -->The word \"talented\" is abused within the Akademiya, and so are \"born differently,\" \"touched by the archon,\" and such... In Sumeru, one's talents are a trial. Outstanding talent is not necessarily seen as a perfect gift, but it also divides people. For instance, to compliment someone with unimaginable achievements, ordinary folk often call them a \"genius,\" or \"superhuman,\" or a \"prodigy\"... But upon reflection, one will soon notice another layer of meaning that even the speakers themselves have not realized: That the talented and the ordinary are categorically different.<!--\n              -->If someone is capable of things that others aren't, they must have been endowed with some special abilities and gifts. Excessive compliments for and wild imagination regarding outstanding people only serve to alienate them. \"They are successful because they are different\" — such is the typical excuse favored by underachievers. These ignorant notions mean nothing to Alhaitham. Though he does know his way around people, he will not waste his time on such trivial matters.<!--\n              -->Rules define borders and set limits. Yet these rules should not be judged solely on the number of people they limit. Therefore, Alhaitham has come up with his own set of rules with which he perceives everything and challenges the world. It is the crystallization of his philosophy. To maintain these rules of his own fashioning, Alhaitham acts on his own will and deals with anything that appears harmful in his eyes.<!--\n              -->Only with objective judgment can one see the truth. By acknowledging the differences between individuals and recognizing differing levels of capabilities and mental capacities, one will discover the answer right away: Judgment from others is inconsequential, but to leave the right of judgment in others' hands is equal to denying oneself. To be \"different\" should not simply be a label given to you by others. Rather, the talented should have long understood that their uniqueness is also a gift.<!--\n              -->To put it another way, when a talented person truly understands that they are different and that they are indisputably ingenious, only then can they truly understand the value of their abilities. And as for cowards who remain blinded by perspectives advocated by the great majority, they have not yet found their true selves."

    "text": "To live a peaceful and comfortable life, one must meet a few requirements first: Congruous personality and logic, adequate fighting prowess, a slow-paced job, and a cushy house in the vicinity of one's office.<!--\n              -->Alhaitham has checked all the boxes above. He would never deny that no place suits him better than the Nation of Wisdom, where social capital is linked to one's academic abilities.<!--\n              -->His current house, which is located near the Akademiya, is one of the academic resources that he gained through promising research projects. This house's story dates back to Alhaitham's student years. If his classmates still remember him, they will recall that he was not one to mingle with the crowd. As a result, he has only participated in one joint research project. Despite its eventual success, the project resulted in a huge quarrel and a parting of ways. Little do people know about Alhaitham's part in this story, though they might be acquainted with the other protagonist: The Kshahrewar architect Kaveh.<!--\n              -->This academic incident is not very widely-known — and in truth, the tale of two geniuses falling out due to differing perspectives is an all-too-familiar one in the Akademiya. But even though their collaboration did fall through, neither of them will deny the other party's exceptional brilliance. As for their research, the Akademiya would later transfer the relevant assets to the researchers involved as per regulation.<!--\n              -->Although the two did not continue that research, its great success in the early stage still serves as compelling proof of Alhaitham's academic ability. Later, the Akademiya even used this project, which they had forgotten to cancel, as a reference for allocating housing resources, and as such, Alhaitham was given a very decent house befitting his participation in this ingenious project. But the other contributor, Kaveh, had never approached Alhaitham regarding that allocation. It wasn't until later that Kaveh had someone inform Alhaitham and the Akademiya that he was not in want of a house and thus had no use of this property.<!--\n              -->When next they met, Kaveh had gone bankrupt. According to Alhaitham, this former friend of his possesses a personality and values that are not congruous with his abilities. The two differ on too many things and cannot reach a consensus even today.<!--\n              -->Allowing Kaveh to stay in this house provides Alhaitham with an interesting research topic: Legally and socially speaking, since Kaveh has previously forfeited the right to his half of this house, he should pay the landlord during his stay. However, paying rent would, to some extent, deny his contribution to the research, which contradicts the academic spirit.<!--\n              -->An intriguing matter to consider, but Alhaitham has no interest in the answer. Thus, he has taken his broke former colleague in, collects rent as the rightful landlord, and gives his colleague some household chores. He is well aware of the dissatisfaction Kaveh might have, but it matters not to him. As far as Alhaitham is concerned, Kaveh is a familiar face, similarly lacks familial attachments, and is the polar opposite of himself as a scholar — that is to say, an excellent mirror. Human vision is limited, but it can be perfected through the presence of another genius. Taking this opportunity, Alhaitham will be able to observe other aspects of this world and thus understand more things that may have otherwise been unfathomable."

    "text": "The Nation of Wisdom places academics and knowledge above everything else. As such, a scholar acknowledged by others within the Akademiya usually possesses a higher social status. Alhaitham was born to just such a family of well-received scholars. His parents died very early in an accident, and he was raised by his grandmother, a Kshahrewar scholar.<!--\n              -->Alhaitham doesn't have many recollections of his parents. He learned from his grandmother that they were both employed by the Akademiya, with his father being a mentor in Haravatat and his mother, a renowned scholar in Vahumana.<!--\n              -->Alhaitham has inherited his parents' intelligence, and he was always the sharp kid amongst his peers, so much so that he started reading abstruse academic journals at around the age of seven. Having noticed his exceptional talents, Alhaitham's grandmother suggested that he attend school early. However, it only took half a day in the Akademiya for little Alhaitham to report this back to his grandmother: Everyone he met there was boring and he preferred reading alone to listening to their meaningless courses. Alhaitham's grandmother saw his parents' talents and personalities in him, and agreed to let him stay home to be self-taught.<!--\n              -->To Alhaitham, \"to be self-taught\" means to read, break down, reorganize, and question. Due to his family background, he was lucky to be exposed to books made of paper. Interestingly enough, he takes more pleasure in reading his grandmother's hard-copy collections than obtaining knowledge from the Akasha directly.<!--\n              -->As opposed to the Akasha, books are inflexible and rigid, and there is no guarantee that their contents are error-free either. To use such a medium of knowledge is to dance with potential misinformation. The majority of people in Sumeru hate this, but Alhaitham derives great enjoyment from it. It was from reading that he acquired the ability to learn, analyze, and even rectify, and ultimately, he has learned to question. If the rustic and primitive method known as reading is ever any trouble, it is trouble that Alhaitham appreciates.<!--\n              -->Alhaitham's grandmother told him: \"You and your father both like reading. Now, I can't say if the two of you have been given too much share of wisdom or not, but always remember that being different is a gift.\"<!--\n              -->Knowledge is to be recognized, pursued, and trusted, but one should never forget to question it. Perhaps only those who come to such an understanding will not be easily moved by Canned Knowledge and other convenient knowledge media. And only someone who had already met these prerequisites would have casually read the Akasha manual sealed deep within the House of Daena.<!--\n              -->As Alhaitham's grandmother had said, books contain useless information, and sometimes in large amounts, but his sharp mind will sift through them — and if a book he has read lingers in his memory, it will come in handy one day.<!--\n              -->After his grandmother's passing, Alhaitham managed her funeral on his own, inheriting her properties and her small library. Before she passed away, Alhaitham's grandmother gave him this earnest blessing: \"You are such a smart child. Many such people have large egos and a propensity to act on their own. You are outstanding and possess a broader horizon than ordinary people. This is not a bad thing, but you must take care to have a clearer mind than others. You must understand that vain pursuits are but dust, and that you must discern your path with the greatest of wisdom.\"<!--\n              -->Later, Alhaitham applied for the Akademiya and was immediately admitted, scoring high marks in the Haravatat entrance exam. He was informed that his grandmother had also applied for him to be able to attend classes in other Darshans. Following his late grandmother's advice, Alhaitham has always kept a low profile and a clear mind, and always makes decisions for himself.<!--\n              -->Years later, when Alhaitham moved into his new house, he brought all those books over. While sorting through them, he flipped through a few that he had read long ago. The journals that had well-wishes written on their title pages were from his mother's collection, and the ones with reference materials inserted between pages and notes on the margins had once belonged to his father. On top of them, there was a thick book with an exquisite, emerald-colored cover. On the title page, his grandmother had written thus: May my child Alhaitham lead a peaceful life."

    "text": "\"If humans can be doctors to saurians, then saurians can be doctors to humans,\" Ororon once said.\"...Not all juxtaposed statements secretly make sense,\" Ifa replied after a long silence.\"Is that so...\"Ifa couldn't help but feel a twinge of pity at Ororon's tone, for the lad was no fool — just in the habit of sometimes spouting illogical utterances to get some reaction out of him. Ifa knew this deep in his bones, of course. But he couldn't help but look back on his life and wonder: How did he get here?No one can live a life free of things that cannot be helped. Being a vet, for instance, will always be like running a kindergarten — there is no controlling little 'uns who lack powers of reason. All you can do is comfort them... especially when pain must soon follow. Pain from wounds, cleaning wounds, taking medicine and getting injections... Truth be told, were Ifa himself one of those pups or kittens, he would scarcely have been able to tell the difference between those many pains.And when hurt, they cry and they struggle. Such is the nature of all living things. Indeed, losing the ability to feel pain is akin to losing one's natural alarm system — worrying in its own right.And as are the living, perhaps so too is life. Perhaps sorrows and partings exist to remind one that life trundles ever onward, that saurians and humans alike will grow up and grow old.For a doctor, this is par for the course. It's the price that comes with the profession. At least, that's how Ifa reassures himself.And what he receives in return is love and gratitude from humans and animals alike, along with the bonds he has forged with many a \"bro\" of all types and stripes.As long as all joy could wipe away helplessness and sorrow... Then his fight would be well worth it."

    "text": "Sometimes, Ifa feels that one doesn't necessarily choose where they end up in life. Rather, they tend to slot into positions naturally over time.For example, he can't remember when he became someone who looked after others. The neighbors' kids call him bro (or big bro). Saurians, in both sickness and health, follow in his wake, croo-ing and crawww-ing all the while. His juniors and seniors alike tip their hats (where applicable) and call him \"Doc\"... Ifa can't help but feel fear take root in his heart at such treatment.Of course, this respect is also a source of pride and satisfaction for him. So perhaps what gnaws at him from within is the fear that he may one day lose their trust. This spurs him to sometimes go to extreme lengths: making toys for saurian whelps, putting on guitar performances, hauling back bags of fresh fruit for his neighbors each time he returns from treating a patient... Once in a while, one might even spot him helping the tribe's kids with their homework.It was as though someone had messed with the passage of time. One day, Ifa was still vacillating between whether to become a vet or not, his memories of struggling up a saurian's back still fresh as new dew. The next, well, life had happened, and he suddenly realized he'd become a reliable grown-up.Not that this upset him. In fact, Ifa was very grateful. It was just that, occasionally, the tribe's elders would bring up matters of the past, reminding Ifa of the boy he used to be.Some young children love to hear these old stories. One of these young 'uns, who hadn't yet wiped the Volcano Cake crumbs off the corners of his grinning mouth, burst out laughing when he heard about how a young Ifa could barely get a book through his head. \"So big bro Ifa was once lil' bro Ifa! How crazy is that?\"Nobody had called him \"lil' bro\" in ages and ages. Ifa was stunned for a moment, but recovered quickly. He wiped the kid's mouth with a napkin, chortling, \"It ain't that crazy! How old are you, hmm?\"\"I'm six!\"\"Well, what do you know, little buddy? I'm five! How 'bout I start calling you big bro from now on, mm?\""

Theirs is a household renowned for their veterinary skills, but on closer inspection, not many in the family actually pursue that line of work. In other words, neither sentiment nor logic dictated that he had to become a vet.Moreover, studying for such a career is an exhausting process. Ifa felt that all he had to read while growing up were books on medicine, and the words and diagrams blew through his brain like a breeze — in one end, out of the other. Little Ifa angrily thought to himself: I don't have to become a vet, do I?He didn't have to, but soon enough, he found himself over the phase where books were beyond his understanding. Maybe it was due to their frequent visits to battlefields to tend to the sick, but Ifa's parents were affected by the Abyss, and their health was persistently poor. Although he was still young, some sort of revelation came over Ifa, and he often worriedly thought to himself: I... don't have to become a vet, do I...?Epiphany or not, early maturity or not, Ifa was not yet full-grown before his parents passed away. After attending their funeral, the seventeen-year-old was overwhelmed by a hollow sensation. Now, he didn't know what to think at all.And in the end, he became a vet.Perhaps it was for tradition's sake, or mere force of habit, but Ifa soon became known as the sauro-vet with the finest skills, the gentlest temper, and the strongest sense of responsibility. Once his heart was set, his mind dwelled on other matters no longer. And as the war raged ever fiercer, his list of tasks only grew, but it was this very burden of work that helped him through a difficult period of his life.Now that the war was finally over, Ifa found himself with time to sit down and think about his life. But really, was there much to consider at all?\"Everyone's got something they gotta do,\" Ifa decided. \"And I just want everyone to be happy.\""

    "text": "If he gave himself over to his sympathy and adopted every wounded little saurian he came across, Ifa would have to leave his clinic for a life in the wilderness. He knows himself best — were he to start walking down this path, he'd walk it all the way. That's why he has an unwritten rule: If at all possible, he is not to take in any animals (or humans, or other miscellaneous creatures) long-term.\"No, no, nooo way...\" Ifa shielded his eyes from his latest little patient's pitiful gaze, \"I'll definitely find this lil' guy a new home... but I'm stretched way too thin to keep him myself.\"His discipline over the years has been commendable — which is why he's still loath to admit that Cacucu proved the exception to the rule.\"This lil' bro just doesn't grow,\" Ifa has a whole laundry list of excuses, ready to go. \"He's small, he's round, and can talk, but doesn't really know what he's sayin'... Might be dangerous to leave him all by his lonesome out in the wild like this. S'why I've taken him under my wing... Y'know, for now at least.\"\"Actually, he's being taken advantage of. He's just too embarrassed to admit it,\" Ororon would say, laying the truth bare.But though Ororon would then pretend that the matter had nothing to do with him, he had in fact \"contributed\" to Cacucu's adoption by pointing at the vegetables in his field sporting prominent Cacucu-beak-shaped holes in their leaves, the gesture a silent accusation directed at Ifa.Unable to come up with excuses, or shake Cacucu off in the slightest, Ifa was at last forced to (or so he made it look) adopt the former. He even offered to be Ororon's courier for a month to compensate him for the Cacucu-related crop damages.But taking a step back, this story actually has two gaps, to which Ifa has remained none the wiser.The first: The peculiar case of the field. Cacucu is not some foolish saurian, so why did he start messing with Ororon? In truth, the two had been partners-in-crime the whole time. For Cacucu to realize his lofty dream of becoming an assistant at Ifa's clinic, the first step was to get into the clinic at all. And to do that, they had to back Ifa into a corner.And the second: Although Ifa believes the first time he saw the roly-poly Qucusaur was when he rescued him out on the road, Cacucu remembers another, older chapter to their tale. None know this, but Cacucu's mother was once badly injured, and she may have never hatched the egg containing this little genius of a saurian were it not for Ifa's intervention. And when said saurian pecked through the shell of his egg, he saw Ifa for the first time. Sadly, Ifa does not remember this.On the one hand, Cacucu lacks the vocabulary to relate the incident. On the other, there was never a need to, and so Cacucu has never attempted to inform Ifa. His mother eventually passed on due to old injuries relapsing, and it was a tall order for a small saurian to survive alone in the wild. Having not brushed shoulders with many humans at all, Cacucu quickly decided that Ifa, who had helped his mother once before, was a prime candidate to follow around. And if he could one day become an assistant in that clinic and repay the favor owed, then all the better. What a wonderful feat in the saurian world that would be!With the first step now out of the way, now came phase two of Cacucu's master plan: figuring out how to play dumb.Considering Ifa's personality — someone all too happy to shoulder other's responsibilities — knowing Cacucu's backstory could create in him an inexplicable sense of guilt and make him feel somehow accountable.So Cacucu decided it was best to skip all that nonsense. If they were to become bros, he wanted their bro-ship to come from a point of sincerity, unclouded by the past."

    "text": "In all seriousness, Ifa considered himself quite athletic. And between getting along well with saurians and passing his flying trials with flying colors, he figured he should be able to easily traverse all of Natlan.So he decided to swing by and visit the other tribes while he remained unburdened by much responsibility.In the Children of Echoes, he met the skilled blacksmith Xilonen. She proved quite eager, drawing up designs for Ifa's medical equipment without too much debate. He later learned that the Xilonen he'd met had been one very much burdened by responsibility — that of a commission from Mavuika — and so any work unrelated to it had been a breath of much-needed fresh air. Others said that Xilonen was usually impossible to get ahold of (on account of her making incredibly quick escapes into the mountains), so Ifa counted his lucky stars.In the Scions of the Canopy, Ifa felt a vibe similar to the Flower-Feather Clan's — that of everyone living life at their own pace amidst the clouds. He enjoyed his time there, slinging grappling hooks and scaling cliffs. His only regret was that he didn't get to meet that legendary \"Saurian Hunter\" everyone had kept talking about. It was only later on, when Ajaw swung by to visit his clinic, that he would see that wish fulfilled. It was a happy ending for everyone — well, except for Ajaw.Before he'd set off, Chasca had told Ifa about a guide he'd find in the People of the Springs named Mualani. His first two attempts to poke around her watersports shop proved fruitless, unless tripping over a Sharky Surfboard counted. Ultimately, he decided to take part in a surfing competition on his own, and it was at the prize ceremony that he at last bumped into her. Upon learning that he'd managed to score third place on his very first time surfing, Mualani showered him with praise. Such warm words from the reigning champ were certainly worth their weight in gold.As for the Collective of Plenty, their fruits were utterly divine, though the trip would have been much more enjoyable had there not been people challenging him to arm wrestle at every corner he turned. Sensing slim odds of victory, Ifa declined dozens of invitations under the pretext that he needed his hands to practice medicine. In the end, this chapter of his journey ended with him signing up for three months of fitness classes with Iansan — none of which he attended, even by the time he bade them all farewell with a hearty wave.As for the Masters of the Night-Wind... it was the closest to the Flower-Feather Clan, and also the most mysterious. Ifa wasn't even sure what one would do there as a visitor, so he thought he'd just stop by on the way home. As he walked, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, and yet every time he turned around, there was no one to be seen. Like an Iktomisaurus chasing its own tail, he engaged in this farcical waltz for a long time, muttering to himself as he did.Just as he was about to leave, a cry of \"Ah!\" stopped him. Ifa spun around for what he hoped would be the last time. There stood a light-haired lady, one hand on her hip and the other pointed at him in anger. Before Ifa could begin considering what he'd done wrong, someone else grabbed him and made a run for it.Everything happened so suddenly that the details were rather lost in the sauce. As it turned out, Ifa had unwittingly been dragged into a great granny-grandson chase, triggered when said grandson had decided to hone his invisibility arts by purposefully standing behind passersby. It'd even worked on the tribe elders.\"My dudes, what are 'invisibility arts'? Do they even exist?\" Ifa's genuine curiosity and good temperament eventually quelled the wrath of Granny Itztli.When he finally dragged himself back home, his parents asked how his journey had been. There was far too much to say, and he was far too tired, so Ifa just replied, \"Had a blast. Met lots of cool bros out there.\"Bros that I'm bound to meet again, he thought to himself."

He spends these rare moments of peace reading through cases new and old, recalling all the illnesses and injuries he has witnessed. Each lesson from the past is valuable, a gem worth sharing with others who would walk this same path.At the same time, aligning the corners of each page is also a good way for Ifa to relax his body and mind.But heroic legends and precious ancient scrolls they are not. These hastily scrawled notes, replete with bland medical jargon, might never draw the gaze of anyone other than their author.But Ifa is not merely \"drawn.\" He is often deeply engrossed in leafing through these old files. As he recalls the details of each diagnosis and treatment, he may even sometimes jot down a few extra notes.Finally, he puts the records back in order and returns them to their cabinet. If necessary, he throws in some pesticide and desiccants as well.These habits bring him through day after day, just as plants grow and wither from season to season."

    "text": "One day, noon came and went without Ifa's clinic opening its doors. Something was up, people were starting to say.At first, the neighbors thought that he'd gone off on call to another tribe and stayed the night there. It wasn't until someone brought a sick saurian to his doorstep that Ifa emerged, groggy and suffering from a sudden high fever.Before the visitor could even open his mouth, Ifa was already muttering, \"All good, bro,\" and giving the saurian a full-body checkup.But as they say, it never rains but it pours. Halfway through writing a prescription, someone else rushed in, crying out that an Abyssal incursion was coming from the direction of the Cinder City, and that a doctor was needed to save the wounded Qucusaurs there.Ifa, again mumbling, \"It's cool, bro,\" followed that rider to the front lines.The night after everything blew over, Ifa drank the medicine his neighbor gave him and passed out for an entire day. When he awoke drenched in sweat, he scrabbled at his bedside table for some water. However, what he found instead was a Vision.Due to his high fever, Ifa's memories were somewhat hazy. To him, what had happened yesterday was little different from his usual routine, and hardly the first time he had forced himself to work while sick. In his eyes, he had done nothing special to warrant the heavens deciding that he totally, absolutely, needed a Vision right now.Everyone else, however, had a different understanding of the matter. The chief believed this was a reward for his selfless work, while the granny next door supposed it was compensation for his spirit of self-sacrifice. \"Hey, hey, ma'am, 'sacrifice' is goin' a bit far!\" Ifa said to that, hastily waving his hands.A child then said to him with wisdom early-grown: \"They say the wind blows people together. Maybe the gods are reminding you that you can rely on your companions when the going gets tough.\" Ifa didn't refute the kid. That was a sensible thing to say, after all. But then again, he had just let his instincts lead him to do what he was supposed to when the going got tough. Had there been any other option?They could have discussed the matter for ages without ever reaching a conclusion. Who could say? Perhaps the heavens thought that a cool breeze was just the right fix for his fever. Shaking his head, Ifa brought things to a close, letting the matter rest.He wouldn't even use his Vision most of the time — at least, not before he took Cacucu in. After the latter became part of his life, he insisted on having Ifa take him flying everywhere, punctuating said excursions with squawks of \"Higher, bro! Higher!\"In times like these, his Vision proved very handy indeed."

Nor have any of these people noticed the theft — to them, it may as well have been magic.<!--\n              -->And because she must maintain this razor focus while working, Lynette speaks little to conserve her energy and not divide her attention.<!--\n              -->Even in her daily life, or when she is at rest, she habitually filters out all kinds of useless information...<!--\n              -->That said, what information counts as useful and what counts as useless is completely up to her.<!--\n              -->For example, what about machine operating and housework-related skills? Why, if one never does them, one can safely and confidently tuck them away in the back of one's mind.<!--\n              -->And when caught up in teatime gossip, one merely needs to occasionally append the conversation with \"I see,\" \"Is that so,\" and \"And then...\" to ensure a smooth-running chat.<!--\n              -->Economy of energy — just the way she prefers it."

    "text": "People often believe that Lynette's cat ears are a part of her performance attire, as the same blood flows in her and Lyney's veins, yet he appears no different from ordinary people.<!--\n              -->However, Lynette's ears and tail do, in fact, grow on her body — they are real as real can be.<!--\n              -->It is said that these cat-like features are inherited, but that even as such a bloodline grows thin across generations, instances of \"atavism\" can still occur from time to time.<!--\n              -->When she was young, Lynette did not love this particular gift from her ancestors.<!--\n              -->There would always be some curious kid who would, whether intentionally or inadvertently, point at them and ask her: Why are you different from everyone else? Are you and Lyney not real siblings?<!--\n              -->The introverted Lynette did not know how to reply, nor could Lyney always be with her. Whenever such things would happen, she could only push her ears down, curl her tail up, and squat in a corner, by herself and beside herself with misery.<!--\n              -->Only alley cats would come to comfort her, coiling around and rubbing against her ankles.<!--\n              -->She could not let her brother see her like this, she knew. He already had a great many things to worry about — he did not need this kind of trivial matter on his mind as well.<!--\n              -->But she could not simply pretend that nothing was wrong — to deceive the genius magician, she had to fool herself first.<!--\n              -->So she hugged the cat tightly to herself, softly brushing the fur on its back. As she felt its light breath, calm slowly returned to her heart.<!--\n              -->By the time the cat leapt from her arms, her face had regained its usual placid appearance.<!--\n              -->Among Fontaine's nobility, there are also some novelty-seeking degenerates. During one party, a certain \"important person\" found themselves taken with Lynette's unusual appearance.<!--\n              -->Over her protests, despite her struggling, the siblings' foster father stuffed her into that person's carriage without a second thought, almost as if giving away a sofa-scratching cat.<!--\n              -->Why her? Why was she born with these ears?<!--\n              -->In her suffocating solitude, Lynette once again covered her ears in pain, unable to hold back the bitterness repressed over long years.<!--\n              -->\"Stop hiding. Cowering will get you nowhere.\" That voice shone through the darkness with the moonlight. \"Come out. The one who wished to harm you is dead.\"<!--\n              -->That voice was cruel ice, and yet it had a spellbinding, comforting power also. Lynette lifted her eyes, and there she saw the person she would in later days call \"Father.\"<!--\n              -->\"You have good ears. Learn to use them.\"<!--\n              -->\"Father\" kneaded Lynette's ears. That touch was not gentle. Indeed, they were as cold as the moon's light.<!--\n              -->And like that light, it illuminated a corner of the darkness.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->\"When a cat's ears are folded backward, that often indicates fear or vigilance, and if they stand up and point forward, that usually indicates a good mood...\"<!--\n              -->Whenever Lyney tells new members of Hotel Bouffes d'ete about the habits of ordinary cats, he will often steal a glance at his younger sister nearby.<!--\n              -->Lynette's ears are straight, they face the front, and they occasionally flutter outward.<!--\n              -->It has been a long time since she last folded them back."

Yet they had not the strength to flee, and thus could only stare into her eyes anxiously.<!--\n              -->Lynette said nothing, nor did she reach out to further startle them. Instead, she simply looked back at them in silence.<!--\n              -->Slowly they seemed to come to the understanding that she meant them no harm, and eventually dipped their straining necks.<!--\n              -->Only then did Lynette pick the box of cats up, and they laid down in silence, allowing this young lady to take them back to their new \"home.\"<!--\n              -->There was some small debate amongst family members as to whether the animals should be taken in, but the usually reticent Lynette put her foot down, insisting that they stay.<!--\n              -->The argument somehow managed to reach the ears of none other than \"Father,\" and she had the final word — which was that her children should cease the silly squabbling.<!--\n              -->\"Those who wish to raise them, do so yourselves — but do it well. Don't make trouble for others.\"<!--\n              -->After a short silence, she then added, \"And if you have not taught them how to follow the rules by the end of winter, get rid of them yourselves.\"<!--\n              -->That statement put paid to the rest of the argument. As for the task of teaching the cats, it fell to Lynette.<!--\n              -->Considering that Lynette was usually averse to busywork, Freminet had the automated feeding machine custom made.<!--\n              -->The machine came with an internal clock and a weighing machine that could allow it to feed the kittens various foods at precise times and in fixed amounts.<!--\n              -->This machine, in turn, became one of the few machines to survive Lynette's tender mercies, never breaking down across many years of service. Indeed, its inner components have remained spanking new, with only the plate beneath the food outlet showing much sign of use.<!--\n              -->And this... is because Lynette has never used it properly.<!--\n              -->The sort of food to add into each box, how to input feeding times and amounts... Rather than memorize that, she found it more convenient to personally prepare the cat food in a plate.<!--\n              -->Moreover, if she had to leave even feeding to a machine...<!--\n              -->Lynette squatted next to the Non-Automated Feeding Machine, stroking the satisfied cats' fur in silent thought.<!--\n              -->...How would she be able to teach these children?"

They could pull food to fill their stomachs from hats, and fire to keep themselves warm. Lyney wouldn't have to constantly busy himself keeping them both alive.<!--\n              -->But the gods never answered her prayers. In later days, she and Lyney would wander on, and after several twists and turns on the city streets and in noble mansions, they found a place to plant their feet under the aegis of their \"Father.\"<!--\n              -->Both of them knew how hard this chance was to come by, and so they endured the harsh training and supported each other through countless missions.<!--\n              -->Reality had eroded their childish innocence all too early, and the dream of possessing a Vision, too, had fallen by the wayside of the past.<!--\n              -->During a certain mission, they were dispatched to perform at a noble's mountain villa in order to steal incriminating evidence that their target had hidden in a study.<!--\n              -->The mission itself was ordinary, and it went quite well. During their performance, the two would tamper with a window in the villa. Once it was over, they would be able to re-enter stealthily and make off with the evidence without a trace.<!--\n              -->But just as they had succeeded, three flares went up in the forest outside the window — a message from their \"family members\" keeping watch.<!--\n              -->Three flares meant the worst-case scenario: that the Maison Gardiennage was also targeting this person, and indeed had already dispatched forces to the scene.<!--\n              -->If they retreated the way they came, they had a high chance of encountering Maison personnel, and if they were exposed as having conducted their mission in their guise as magicians, not only would they be doomed, but their \"family members\" would be implicated as well.<!--\n              -->The voices outside the study were growing louder — if they wished to escape as quickly and stealthily as possible, they would have to take a risk.<!--\n              -->The villa retreat was built against the mountain, and out the window was a cliff, beneath which was a swift river.<!--\n              -->Lynette exchanged a glance with her brother, and without a word, they grasped each others' hands tightly, and leapt out the window.<!--\n              -->The rippling waves below slammed into Lyney with a terrible crash.<!--\n              -->He had attempted to absorb the impact with his shoulder just as they impacted, protecting his sister once again, but the impact with the water swallowed his consciousness.<!--\n              -->Desperate, Lynette grabbed onto a floating piece of wood, and by sheer dint of will managed to drag her unconscious brother to shore, coughing up water as she struggled on.<!--\n              -->Fighting the searing pain in her lungs, she checked his condition in a panic. He was deathly pale, his eyes squeezed shut — there was none of his usual vitality to be seen.<!--\n              -->She hugged him tightly to prevent his temperature from dropping further, even as she surveyed her surroundings. The forest was dark, and in that lightless night the twisted trees seemed ever more malevolent.<!--\n              -->She called his name softly, hoping that he might stand up again with a grin, just as he had in their prior performances. But this time, the only reply she received was his fragile and weak breathing.<!--\n              -->The loneliness and fear of that fateful night so many years ago seized her heart once again.<!--\n              -->It had been so long, and they'd been through so much — she'd grown from that, or so she thought.<!--\n              -->Why, then, were things just like before? Could she do nothing but wait for someone to defend her? As she trembled in the darkness?<!--\n              -->No. No. It should have been different. They had made so many miracles by their own hand, conquered so many obstacles.<!--\n              -->...She had wished to stand behind him, supporting him, back to back, shoulder to shoulder.<!--\n              -->The Maison personnel could be patrolling nearby. She dared not call out to their \"family members,\" nor could they stay here.<!--\n              -->The only thing she could do now was grasp Lyney's hand tightly, and haul him onto her shoulders.<!--\n              -->If she could not see the way forward, then she would hear it.<!--\n              -->Extending her ears as high as she could, she listened out for even the slightest wisp of wind.<!--\n              -->And the wind sang through the branches and through the bushes, and brushed against her face... and they gradually painted for her a blurry scene.<!--\n              -->Lynette groped forward in the dark, the thorns along the path piercing her skin and staining her clothes red.<!--\n              -->Slowly, the sight before her eyes became clearer. Perhaps her ears had grown used to the wind, or her eyes, accustomed to the darkness, but her steps grew more agile, more resolute.<!--\n              -->In this stage without spotlights, in this performance without plaudits, Lynette had at last become the star.<!--\n              -->As the rays of dawn darted into the woods, Lynette carried her brother back to the rendezvous point of their \"family,\" only to encounter someone unexpected — their \"Father\" had personally made the trip down last night.<!--\n              -->Using the last of her strength, Lynette retrieved the sodden evidence from her bosom, but before she could hand it over, her legs gave out, taking Lyney down with her in the fall.<!--\n              -->\"Father\" grabbed them both, allowing the incriminating information to fall to the earth and be soiled.<!--\n              -->\"Sleep now. You've retrieved... a far more valuable prize.\"<!--\n              -->A Vision, reflecting both the dawn sun and the twins' sleeping faces, hung at Lynette's waist, glowing silently."

    "text": "With Liyue as his base of operations, the exorcist Chongyun roams the land, ridding it of evil. As the heir to a clan of exorcists, he has always possessed abilities superior to most. However, this ability is not the result of training, but of an inborn trait he has come to term, \"congenital positivity.\"\nCongenital positivity is an exceedingly rare physiology that makes the body susceptible to heating up due to an overabundance of positive energy. If unchecked, those who possess such a form can easily become hot blooded. Chongyun is a particularly serious case, his shifts in mood are explosive, and he remembers nothing from such episodes. However, Chongyun's condition is also his greatest asset, for all he needs to do to expel evil spirits is to sit awhile in whatever dark corner they may haunt.\nAs such, Chongyun's path as an exorcist has been smooth as smooth can be. However, he himself does not approve of this manner of doing things. In his honest and upright heart, leaning on his unique physiology to exorcise evil is but a cheap trick. An exorcist must, in his estimation, perform their duties with an exorcist's arts.\nTo counteract this congenital positivity, Chongyun has several disciplines that he practices. He does not go out in the sun or wear thick clothes, and he abstains from hot beverages and hot and spicy food. He takes up no quarrels, and he indulges no tempers. Yet despite searching high and low, and far and wide, he has been unable to find a lasting solution to his condition.\nThis troubled the young exorcist. The evil spirits were expelled, yes, but if things kept going like this, how would he ever prove himself to be a qualified exorcist?\nAs he sits atop an ice-capped mountain chewing on a snow bun, Chongyun cannot help but sigh. The road ahead is still long indeed."

And regardless of the truth of such rumors, someone has to do something about them.Chongyun was born into a renowned family of exorcists, and has possessed a natural ability to drive away evil spirits from a young age due to his pure-yang spirit. His powers of exorcism are far beyond the norm: his mere presence is sufficient to scatter evil spirits.However, this has proven to be an inconvenience for Chongyun himself, for though he has undertaken hundreds of successful exorcisms, he has never come face-to-face with a single ghost or demon.Chongyun believes in his heart that a true exorcist should exorcize evil with charms and swordsmanship. This natural ability that he has... is just not orthodox.Therefore, he has dedicated himself to the study of exorcism techniques and martial arts, as well as seeking the haunts of evil spirits to prove himself an able and professional exorcist even without his unique physical condition.Yet, when will that condition stop being a stumbling block on his path to self-realization?"

    "text": "When Chongyun first ventured out as an exorcist, there had been much talk of an evil spirit lurking inside Liyue Harbor.The victim of these hauntings was a woman from a family with a high enough stature to even have a word or two with the Liyue Qixing.From a time she knew not when, her sleep began to be harassed by sounds that kept her awake, but every time she tried to follow the sound, it would suddenly shift behind her, and begin ringing again in her ears.This shock caused her unspeakable distress, and she even lost weight for loss of appetite.Her wealth was enough to hire the best exorcists from all over, but no matter what they tried, they had to retreat empty-handed. And not only did the noises persist, they even grew in boldness.It was then, just when she had given up all hope, that Chongyun walked through her door.\"I apologize for coming just now, it has been far too sunny lately... I heard that this place houses a very stubborn ghost. Please, leave it to me.\"Then Chongyun brought a chair over, and sat upon it in the middle of the house for a time.That night, the strange sounds were no more.The wealthy woman finally had a good night's sleep, and she came running to Chongyun the next morning with an overabundance of gold and jewelry as a reward.But Chongyun, as was his wont, only accepted his usual fee of a few hundred Mora without an ounce of emotion on his face.Ever since that incident, Chongyun has found that his reputation precedes him for miles around. He has become beloved in Liyue for his \"style and character,\" and indeed scholars have given him this appellation: \"a heart of clear water, and a face of ice.\""

When he heard about an evil spirit in Dragonspine, he made for the peak wearing only a shirt.Though it was hard enough to keep himself warm, he still felt this insufficient. Digging a hole in a frozen lake, he jumped in and soaked in the icy water while waiting for the evil spirit to show itself.After staying in the lake for half a day, he finally caught a glimpse of his target.However, after pursuing it down to the mountainside, he discovered it was only a snow rabbit that had been frightened off by his flying swords and floating charms.The fever that he ran afterward lasted far longer than it would in a normal person."

And though he waited until all the dishes had gone cold, he did not expect the tender rice balls to be stuffed with Jueyun Chili.After but a single bite... Chongyun had no recollection of what happened next.However, according to the victim, chef Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant, many unforgettable things happened.Chongyun first jumped onto the reception desk and shouted, \"Everything's on me tonight!\" — never mind that he did not actually have any money on him.He then began to chat with customers at other tables as if they were old pals, bragging to them of how incredible his clan's exorcist arts were, never forgetting to taste other people's dishes on the tables before he left.Lastly, he claimed to have sensed an evil spirit in Wanmin Restaurant. This he did not find, but he did slap a charm on Xiangling's forehead and chase her around with his sword.Afterwards, Chongyun scrimped and saved for an entire month to pay Wanmin Restaurant back for the mess and any damages he might have caused; he also gave Xiangling an evil-warding talisman that he carved by hand.But Xiangling, for her part, didn't mind Chongyun's \"transgressions\" at all. Instead, she felt that the crazy Chongyun was the real Chongyun, without any personal walls up."

Since then, Chongyun has no longer sought to alleviate his condition. Instead, he now tries to get Xingqiu to come with him to find such a spirit.\"What? Sightings of the legendary Aoyin near the Sea of Clouds? Leave it to me!\"\"The old house at Feiyun Slope has been taken over by an evil spirit? My bad. I'll attend to it right away.\"\"A master exorcist is staying over at Wangshu Inn? I could learn a lot from him... Hmm, better go with a gift.\"Xingqiu usually just makes these \"leads\" up as he goes, and thanks to his \"advice,\" Chongyun often comes back empty-handed, blaming his bad luck.\"I tried my best to look for it, and even spent quite a sum purchasing more intelligence on that evil spirit — but I wound up missing it by a hair anyway,\" Chongyun says, abashed.If Xingqiu has time to spare when such an occasion arises, he will encourage Chongyun, treat him to some new cold dishes he has found and then set off to get Chongyun's swindled money back.A warm and reliable companion, indeed! — So Chongyun thinks at such moments. Who could he possibly trust, if not his fine friend Xingqiu?"

Even the sound of that scares him a hundred times more than freezing in a lake on Dragonspine.However, he has also heard everyone sing yearning praises of these hot springs, praising their comfort, and asserting that they become more so the hotter they are, and that one is filled with energy for a whole week afterward.Chongyun still doesn't know if this is true or if people are just teasing him.And he would have dared to try it out, if not for the ever-present problem of his pure-yang spirit.Xingqiu once asked him this:\"If you were able to master your yang energy and rid the world of all evil spirits someday...what would you do after that?\"This seemingly off-the-cuff remark troubled Chongyun deeply.Perhaps he had indeed missed out on a lot in life on account of his condition.But he doesn't regret spending time. If one way of living doesn't work, he just needs to find himself another — and in any case, he already has his answer.If that day comes, well, he'll go to the hot springs then."

Unwilling to break with this artistic tradition, he was at a loss.Ultimately, he would attempt to use his imagination to draw some suitably strange images.—Thus did the Field Guide to Demons and Beasts grow ever more exotic.

Well, I did ask him to write on this topic, yes, but isn't this the hot genre of the day?\"Faced with the editor's doubtful gaze, Miko gave her opinion forthrightly: that a book that should have been interesting yet was shackled at every turn by the topic was, simply put, \"not free enough.\"Things like \"top sellers,\" \"genre fiction,\" these were naught but fads that would come and go every decade.Getting with the times was a shortcut, yes, but if a work had the quality that could surmount this tide, why go with the flow nonetheless?\"Pass this message to this new author of ours: tell him that there's no need to bother about genre. He just needs to write his story and write it well.\"Upon hearing this, the author stopped writing for a time, as if suddenly having an epiphany. Several months later, a new manuscript was sent to Miko and her editors.The latter were stunned, and even Yae Miko, who cared little about taboos, furrowed her brows slightly — a rare sight indeed.\"Um... What do we do? This isn't good...\"\"Exactly! I mean, there's 'not being concerned about genre, and then there's something like 'Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden'... This is just too much!\"\"Hmm? Genre? No, no, there's no problem with that — it's his pen name I'm worried about. It's too normal for a book like this.\"\"Huh, so that was what you were concerned about... No, uh, never mind. As long as you're happy, Lady Yae.\"Not long after, the author of this book would take to the literary stage with the Yae Miko-approved (and overly long) pen name \"Kadenokouji Kenzaburou.\"As to how the editor-in-chief got the idea to start a \"Reborn as Guuji Yae\" writing submission event, that would be a tale for another day."

As the years fly by, boredom becomes the greatest foe.And if even she were, archon-forbid, one day to accept sitting quietly still, obstinate as deadwood, would the world now sorely lack for another clever person adept at discovering fun and grasping opportunity?As such, looking for fun things to do in every nook and cranny can only be the most reasonable and necessary course.And if she were to, say, utilize her authority as Guuji in making fun things happen — why, some things are unavoidable, are they not?On the day of the festival, Guuji Yae would nod in satisfaction as she received a delivery of fireworks from the Yashiro Commission — of Naganohara construction and specially-made to boot.That night's ceremony was, of course, performed with perfect respect to all etiquette and rites.The sight of the \"Lady Guuji\" kneeling gracefully the whole night through would be the object of awe for all the other shrine maidens.In the meantime, she would sit beneath the meteor shower of light adorning the skies, watching the festival-goers as they came and went.And the din of the fireworks covered the mumbling that came between teeth chewing on a candy apple.\"You know, when you asked me to become Guuji, you never mentioned that I'd only ever be able to sneak outside to watch the festivities from then on.\""

I mean, one can barely stand to watch those owners cry their eyes out as it is...\"Having done all this, the lady could not help but let slip a pleased smile.Taking part in Inazuma's daily life in such an identity really was fun.Well, except that part where Kujou Sara shot her a suspicious glance as they passed each other by.Right, and also, she probably owed the boss of Aisa Bathhouse an apology — the outland-styled hot springs were indeed very good, but she might have accidentally shed some fox fur during the soak."

But no one minded, asking only that the tale be interesting. As time passed, this became known as \"hyakumonogatari daikai,\" or \"the great meeting of a hundred tales.\"It was no uncommon sight to see Urakusai raise his cup and speak, holding all the other youkai spellbound with his story, drawing even smiles from Kitsune Saiguu, the organizer of the event.Instead it was Miko, who was then in the form of a young kitsune, who would perch on Kitsune Saiguu's shoulder and relentless peck at any loopholes in Urakusai's story.Urakusai, being a cool-headed and brilliant gentleman, would explain as he twirled his beard.But Miko could always find something new to nitpick, and so they would go, back and forth, until Lady Saiguu would smile and call both parties to a halt: the audience wanted to hear the next part, after all.After another three rounds of drink and several more rounds of stories, the company would be hard-pressed to even string a sentence together, let alone a story.And so the gathered youkai would dispense with the word-fencing and use their powers to take to the skies to see who could best cover the sky and moon with their powers.And thus it was said that \"a hundred youkai shall parade upon a moonless night.\"Five hundred years on, that little kitsune has already become a mighty youkai in her own right.As for the youkai who drank with them in those days, they disappeared amidst war and history, and their remaining bloodlines grow thinner by the day.And thus did their great parade, the Hyakkiyakou, become something that happened \"a long, long time ago.\""

    "text": "The swords of Inazuma have always been famous the world over, and the best works of the Raiden Gokaden in particular are national treasures.However, only a short time ago, more than half of the five artisan lineages were cut off.A great number of powerful people were caught up in that conspiracy, and those responsible were all called to account and banished.Even the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was implicated due to their failure in supervising their subordinates...But before the Shogun could give her final judgment, the Lady Guuji, who usually did not meddle in government affairs, suddenly interceded, rescuing the Kamisato Clan in their hour of peril.Thus, while they suffered a serious blow, they were spared from dismissal.In the years that followed, others would speculate greatly concerning the Guuji's actions.Some observed the close relations between the Yashiro Commission and the Grand Narukami Shrine, and guessed that she had intended to foster advocates loyal to her.And yet the shrine had always been an entity unto itself, and the Lady Guuji did not usually meddle in governance. Thus this action seemed a sacrifice greater than the reward — hardly a wise decision.Some others said that the Guuji suspected something to be wrong with the whole situation, and now that the list of those involved was so extensive, any major shakeup in the Yashiro Commission could destabilize Inazuma itself.This thought, too, seemed reasonable on face, yet did not stand up to scrutiny. After all, was not the rise and fall of great houses merely ordinary in the grand scheme of mortal affairs? And even if the Kamisato were to fall from grace, new leadership for the Yashiro Commission would emerge.Yet another story said that Miko engaged in secret talks with the Kamisato clan head just after the initial shockwaves had died down.But the wounded clan was like a candle in the wind at this point. What power could they have to change the situation?To this day, all these speculations have never amounted to anything, nor have any answers emerged concerning Miko's actions and motivations.But what none know is how Miko's words that day would become as engraved into the Kamisato Clan as their house's crest.\"That the Kamisato Clan has survived this incident is only due to the Shogun's mercy. Do not forget this in the days that follow.\"These words would serve as a seed of destiny, foreshadowing the Yashiro Commission's future position.In some other time, if a storm were to descend upon Inazuma, and even if they were to come into conflict with the other two commissions, the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan would remember the favor they were shown and abide the Shogun's path to Eternity.This was a move that the Guuji played with no regrets whatsoever."

It's not like the fire brigade has ever gotten a year-end bonus or anything.\"As such, after some preparation, the Fire-Soothing Festival of that year would be changed to no longer feature dancing shrine maidens but a grand, rollicking light novel submission contest.The organizing body for this competition and any subsequent publications, the \"Yae Publishing House,\" would also \"borrow\" the Fire-Soothing Festival Committee's budget.As for the profits? Into the shrine's coffers they went.\"Well, we no longer have many fires, and yet our budget keeps increasing. Thus, this restructuring relieves the financial burden placed upon the people.\"\"Also, the study of lore and the writing of literature and poetry is also a way of pleasing our Archon — surely you do not claim to know more of ritual and ceremony than I?\"That was what Yae Miko said most solemnly to Kujou Takayuki when he came by unannounced.The Tenryou Commissioner was ultimately forced to leave the way he came, stormy-faced, along with his attendants.Little did any of them know that the moment they stepped out of the shrine, the somber Lady Miko would pluck a novel manuscript from the nearby offering box and continue annotating it."

Am I not getting enough sleep?\nAnd just like that, the pint-sized ninja who awoke to this thought drifted off to sleep again.\nSayu firmly believes that sleep can replenish all her energy and help her grow taller. In order to live by this principle and have as much time to nap as possible, she honed her ninjutsu to perfection.\nFleeing, hiding, transforming... Sayu is the master of all ninjutsu techniques. An unsuspecting leaf or a bucket? It might be just one of Sayu's many disguises!\nAs a result, if the Shiyuumatsu-Ban needs Sayu's help, they need to commit all efforts to finding her first.\nOf course, from Sayu's point of view, this so-called \"laziness\" is just better time allocation which allows her to focus on things... like sleeping and growing taller."

She has been raised in the Shuumatsuban since she was a child, and is extremely loyal to the organization.That said, her most prominent trait is not \"loyalty\", but \"laziness.\"Lazing around is what Sayu does best. She has long mastered the various arts of ninjutsu, particularly those that help her to slack off or shirk her duties, such as escape techniques and aura concealment.People who don't know about her habits will have to make a lot of effort to find her.However, if you ask Sayu about her slacking, she will shrug and reply, \"It's not that I'm lazy, I just want to spend my time on more meaningful things.\""

Therefore, if she has the intention to hide, ordinary people absolutely cannot find her.However, even the most ingenious puzzles have answers, and even the most elusive treasures have clues for people to find them. This also holds true for Sayu.After spending enough time with Sayu, one will understand her habits and preferences. Trying to find her doesn't seem so difficult anymore.For example, if you go to Sayu's room early in the morning and lift the covers, the odds are that you will find her in bed.At noon, you can check out the trees near the shrine and who knows, you may find something unexpected.It will be more challenging to find Sayu at night, but it's a good idea to go to her house and wait for her to emerge.However, please remember not to disturb Sayu, who is busy growing taller, unless it is absolutely necessary.Even gentle rabbits bite when provoked, let alone Sayu..."

The incredible scene is comparable to an artistic performance.Thus, whenever there is a festival, Sayu will be invited by various parties to perform her mysterious ninjutsu.If it's Yoimiya who's searching for her, Sayu can still find ways to hide.But if the person in question is Lady Guuji Yae, resistance is futile for Sayu.Clone techniques do nothing to fool the Lady Guuji's sharp eyes, and aura concealment doesn't help Sayu at all in escaping from the Lady Guuji's grasp.Running for the hills is even less feasible, and might even risk angering the Lady Guuji...Fortunately, there are very few circumstances that require Lady Guuji Yae to make a personal appearance."

Once she was capable enough to defend herself, her sensei chose to leave quietly.A young animal that leaves the protection of its parents will grow up rapidly. The same is true of the sensei's expectations for Sayu.The young ninja did not disappoint her sensei. Soon after, Sayu obtained a Vision.And then, she started working diligently in the Shuumatsuban... diligently shirking her duties.Sayu is always busy sleeping and hiding from people, so in that sense, she also has a lot to do.Occasionally, when Sayu is free and alone to enjoy the moonlight, she feels lost deep inside.The people who have always been with you will one day leave...is this how life is meant to be?But perhaps someday in the future, I will also meet the person who will always be with me.Pondering the matter, the little ninja fell asleep again..."

The only way to understand what it's like is to have experienced it.This is exactly what happened to Sayu. Adept at observation and evasion, she has always understood that she is not suitable for combat.Her overly petite stature gives her no advantage in terms of strength to speak of, and her ninjutsu will not be of much use in actual combat.Yet missions do not wait for ninjas to grow fully before descending upon them. In an era of turmoil, Sayu would also find herself in trouble because of not-so-important work.Surrounded by strong foes, she had to do her best and barely managed to escape. It cost her almost everything to bring the information back safely.Exhausted and wounded, Sayu was about to faint, but only one thing lingered in her mind:\"It's not only strong brute force that can overpower everything, the weak have their own way of surviving. It's because you're weak that you can notice those unseen moments that change your fate... The chances of escaping from here are slim, but that's what my ninjutsu is for.\"The moment the leaves fell, she disappeared. All her pursuers were incredulous. The tiny ninja disappeared as if she were dust in the wind.The next morning, Sayu struggled to get up, and found that the ninja pack strapped to her leg had long since disappeared.However, a surprising object appeared in the same place instead — a Vision gleaming in the sunrise.Now, with the power of the Vision, Sayu can wield a claymore taller than herself. She no longer has to fear the omnipresent strife of a chaotic world.Unfortunately, Sayu's most immediate worries have not yet been resolved.Regarding her growing taller, it seems that even a Vision is unable to do anything about it."

    "text": "According to ancient Inazuman folk tales, as the day wanes and eyelids grow heavy, if you're very lucky, you might just catch a glimpse of a yumekui-baku &mdash; a kind of youkai that can slip into your dreams and devour the nightmares that prey upon your slumber.\nHousehold figures from the world of lore and legend, these youkai gradually sought to carve out a place for themselves within human society. When the Aisa Bathhouse reopened with fresh funding, a group of yumekui-baku &mdash; having taken on the form of human girls &mdash; stepped forth into the public eye as clinical psychologists.\nYet without a shadow of a doubt, there is one who stands out above all the rest, and her name is Yumemizuki Mizuki. Somehow, even when treating the most despondent of clients, she always manages to help them discover a newfound sense of happiness. Within just a few short months of business, a veritable torrent of positive reviews had solidified her reputation as an invaluable asset to the Aisa Bathhouse.\nSome have surmised that the success of such therapy must have something to do with their ability to consume nightmares as yumekui-baku; but confronted with such speculations, Mizuki responds with naught but a knowing smile. Only a handful of people ever sense a hint of the faint weariness hidden beneath her calm demeanor..."

    "text": "Mention the Aisa Bathhouse, and for most Inazumans, the first thing that springs to mind are its artificial hot springs — inspired by those present in Natlan, kitted out with imported facilities, and hailed as a \"go-to destination for relaxation.\"The bathhouse has recently undergone a major renovation, now offering \"psychotherapy\" services that have quickly won it widespread acclaim.Enter Yumemizuki Mizuki, a clinical psychologist who, after having only recently returned to Inazuma, has quickly taken center stage. Known for her holistic approach, she utilizes a combination of the hot springs' warm and soothing waters, serene fragrances, and her own miraculous youkai powers to expel the deep-seated unease troubling her patients.Word gradually got out that this woman — or rather, yumekui-baku in a woman's form — was actually the Aisa Bathhouse's major shareholder; not only the core founding investor, but also the decision-maker behind its recent renovation.Yet she was nothing like your typical behind-the-scenes investor, instead showing both the professionalism of a doctor and the forbearing dedication of an ordinary employee. Immersed in her frontline duties, she meticulously consulted with every patient, diagnosing, prescribing, then administering treatments with pinpoint precision and cool-headed composure.In this way, Mizuki rapidly made quite a name for herself among those tormented by persistent nightmares.The elderly, perhaps, might remember hearing bedtime stories about yumekui-baku in their childhood — and among them, funnily enough, the name of Yumemizuki Mizuki in particular would no doubt ring a bell.Mizuki's peaceful and carefree demeanor, however, make it somewhat difficult for people to associate her with the youkai of those fading legends.But the Aisa Bathhouse is only the first step in Mizuki's grand plan. Although progress has been slow, her vision is to eventually expand into a fully-fledged conglomerate, offering the people of Inazuma both comprehensive entertainment and improved mental well-being.To this end, she continues to explore methods that go beyond simply relying upon her youkai powers — everything from mind-calming exercises to invigorating amusement parks, structured dietary plans, and even traditional games to bring joy and laughter to her patients once more.Knowing little about Mizuki, employees who catch a glimpse of her busy schedule can't help but feel worried for her. Might their boss, clearly far more overworked than any of them, be weighed down by hidden fatigue and anxiety too?"

    "text": "Though it would be unfair to say that the yumekui-baku were entirely unheard of, yet compared to the likes of the kitsune — almost ubiquitous in lore and legend — or the gallant tengu, or the fearsome and awe-inspiring oni, they had never been of any particular renown.At the great gathering known as the \"Hyakumonogatari Taikai,\" the baku were little more than bit-part characters. Some would sit there in a quiet corner sipping away at their tea, while others could be found alongside fellow lesser youkai, listening respectfully to the lofty rhetoric and grandiose tales of the great and mighty. Others still might act as attendants, pouring tea and sake for refined individuals like Urakusai.For the young baku Yumemizuki Mizuki, the sole pleasure of attending those banquets back then lay in marveling at how her friend, the young kitsune Yae Miko, dazzled others with her sharp wit and ingenuity.Watching Miko debating tirelessly with Urakusai, curled up on the shoulder of the older Kitsune Saiguu, Mizuki always ended up munching through several times her usual share of snacks. Delighting in the way she dissected her opponent's arguments, Mizuki often nodded in admiration at her friend's quick thinking, even memorizing her brilliant retorts word-for-word.The next morning, catching sight of a yawning Miko, Mizuki would eagerly approach her with a bowl of freshly-fried tofu, ready to resume their conversation from the night before.Mizuki's near-fawning enthusiasm sometimes caught Miko quite off guard. On such occasions, she would elegantly cover her face with a flick of her fluffy tail, then quickly change the subject by saying, \"Let's go grab some ramen.\"Whether nose-to-bowl in front of Master Karasu's ramen stall, perched up high atop the sturdiest sakura branch on the southern slopes of Mt. Yougou, or lounging on beaches bathed in the setting sun's glow, the young kitsune and the little baku were inseparable, chatting away about everything and anything.Even the untold secrets of their deepest dreams became treasures that they shared with one another.But as the successor to Hakushin Kitsune's bloodline, the duties that awaited Miko, and the responsibilities that growing up entailed for her, were a heavy load to bear indeed.When Miko, then Mizuki in turn, acquired the power to take humanoid form, the two of them were swept apart by the currents of life — just like humans — each carried off to different waters of the world.Under Kitsune Saiguu's tutelage, Miko went on to fathom profound mysteries of youkai magic, and, surrounded by the maidens of the Grand Narukami Shrine, mastered the 880 precepts of the Guuji. As the Hakushin bloodline's rising star, Miko moved through the ranks of the big, the bad, the great, and the good, solidifying her kin's standing in the world of the youkai.Her world was like the vast sea they once gazed at together — tumultuous and ever-changing, filled with all sorts of dangers and challenges, but brimming with endless possibilities too.Mizuki, meanwhile, slipped into an altogether quieter life. Much of her time she spent farming or weaving with her fellow baku to make ends meet, but she would also set off on patrol at fixed times, devouring nightmares for those who sought her help.It was like she'd drifted downstream into a perfectly still lake, placid to the point of monotony.Their outings together grew less and less frequent, until eventually, even their agreement to spend time together once a month became too difficult to keep.Mizuki, however, felt no regret as a result of this.After all, she still left home at exactly the same time as Miko each morning; and when Miko took the bowl of fried tofu that Mizuki had prepared for her, she still gave her that same old smile — reserved only for her closest friends.Mizuki doubted she could bear even a tenth of Miko's responsibilities, and whenever they walked together, she felt crushed by the weight of the gazes that bore down upon them from all sides.She was quite content to play a bit part without many lines, simply providing Miko with a sense of peace when she needed it."

    "text": "Alas, tranquility never lasts forever.That day came when a dark disaster fell upon them all, crashing down like a crumbling rampart. Humans and youkai alike were rendered helpless beneath the weight of its evil, and the islands resounded with cries of despair.Ill-suited for battle, the baku had no choice but to beat a hasty retreat, seeking safety in nooks and crannies of the land so unfrequented that they escaped the calamity's notice.After the last vestiges of evil had finally been vanquished by the Shogun, Mizuki and her kin returned with great trepidation, only to find that their once-thriving settlement had been reduced to ruins.Frantic with worry, Mizuki searched far and wide for her friends, seeing only heartbreaking scenes of loss and separation everywhere she went.Gone without a trace was the familiar figure of Kitsune Saiguu. Instead, Mizuki found Miko — eyes dim, face pale, cheeks streaked with faint trails of tears — bowed in prayer before the withered Sacred Sakura.Thus was the Miko she knew so well prematurely forced to shoulder the responsibilities that awaited her, becoming the revered Guuji Yae.From then on, even their morning encounters became a thing of the past. Snowed under by the avalanche of recovery work, Miko had no choice but to move into the Grand Narukami Shrine, where she worked tirelessly day and night.Soon, the yumekui-baku too found themselves swamped with relentless requests; for the shattered land of Inazuma was now strewn with the traumatized, scarred in both body and mind, humans and youkai alike.The calamity may have been driven back for the time being, but all were haunted by the remembrance of its horrors, and these fears took root in the very depths of their dreams. Night after night, these victims were beset by waves of endless terrors, eating away at their willpower and eroding their resolve.The residual dread was so overwhelming that even the baku elder herself proved unable to withstand it. One day, she collapsed after dispelling the nightmares of several Shogunate samurai, falling into a coma for many months. When she finally awoke, she was too frail to continue performing her duties, and so was forced to retire.It was at this moment that the hitherto unremarkable Yumemizuki Mizuki revealed her talents unlooked-for. When she extracted the dark poison from the victims' minds, the pain she felt was excruciating — not unlike the sensation of being cut or burned. Yet clearly, this was far better than drifting off into a deep sleep that could last for months on end.And so Mizuki became a beacon of hope for the victims, helping them free themselves from the nightmares by which they were tormented. Laden with an unbearable weight of anguish, she would stagger back each day, retreating to a secluded spot to recover in quiet solitude.That may have been Mizuki's most trying time, as she shared every second of the victims' pain. Day and night, her vision was filled with a deep, purplish-blackness that seemed to flow and spread like blood oozing from an open wound.Fortunately, she could draw strength from the image of her dearest friend, carved deeply into her subconscious mind. Whenever Mizuki teetered on the brink of collapse, that cherry-blossom pink always brought her back to her senses.\"As Guuji, it's {{sic|Miko}} job to help the Shogun deal with the problems of the physical world... I, too, must do my duty, and that's to help others overcome their spiritual pain!\"By reassuring herself so, Mizuki always found the strength to continue.Yet, single-mindedly immersed in her work as she was, there was one thing she overlooked — that, in the blink of an eye, a century had flown by.While Mizuki had been tending to her countless patients and calming the turbulence of their traumas, the Miko she once knew had steadily been shaped by the weight of her duties. More frequently, the Guuji now wore the smile of one who mocked the fleeting transience of the mortal world.On the rare occasion that they found themselves sitting together by their old ramen stand, they repeatedly struggled to connect — the air thick with an alien silence, despite the fact that they had once been so close that they could share anything.After much contemplation, Mizuki decided to give her friend the benefit of the doubt and came to terms with the way things had turned out.The pain that Miko suffered during the calamity, she told herself, must have far exceeded her own. Ordinary youkai could not even begin to imagine the burdens entailed by being Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine.Without adopting such pointed composure, she reasoned, Miko may have been unable to endure the relentless onslaught of challenges that had come her way.Having experienced such different environments, it was only natural that their reflections would diverge.At the very least, they had both done their utmost to fulfill their respective duties. The way things were now was but the outcome of having made the best possible decisions that they could have.To rely on a familiar figure as a source of comfort, hoping she would remain forever frozen as she was in memory... Inevitably, that would only serve as a shackle for them both.Whether they liked it or not, their carefree days were gone for good. They each had their own paths to follow, so why not do so freely without clinging to the past?Let the memories of those bygone days stay where they belonged — safe and sound, in the depths of her inner self."

    "text": "Not all nightmares are the same. For individuals who are otherwise sound in mind and body, occasional nightmares caused by passing clouds of gloom are a natural source of nourishment for the yumekui-baku. But the nocturnal terrors of those afflicted by chronic illness or severe trauma are altogether a different animal. The baku may still consume them, even likening the experience to eating flavorless bread, yet their toxic threat remains undiminished.Even Mizuki, the most gifted of her kind, would find herself plagued by persistent ailments if she devoured too many of the latter.To prevent healers from succumbing to the very maladies they sought to cure, Mizuki began exploring methods beyond her natural youkai powers, seeking to detoxify such negative emotions prior to consumption.And so, once she was certain that the dark calamity's lingering shadows had been fully suppressed, Mizuki set off for foreign lands. Her aim was to study humanity's most cutting-edge medical practices in order to develop her very own system of \"clinical psychological therapy.\"In Mondstadt, working with the Adventurers' Guild, she took on a part-time role as a \"post-trauma disorder treatment consultant,\" gaining invaluable experience in hands-on clinical care.In Liyue, under the guidance of the physicians of Chenyu Vale, she familiarized herself with various medicinal herbs that could be used to calm the mind and spirit, as well as the intricate process of cultivating and using them.In Sumeru, inspired by the local incense burners, she built upon her previous explorations of herbal medicines by devising a method of aromatic therapy, using incense as a healing aid to facilitate relaxation and sleep.And in Fontaine, she supplemented her knowledge by delving into the theoretical medical insights of the Research Institute. By considering the scientific underpinnings of avant-garde cinematography, she even discovered fascinating connections between visual patterns and human psychology.After years of study and exploration, Mizuki eventually reached her final destination — the vibrant land of the seemingly indefatigable People of the Springs in Natlan's southern regions.Not only did the \"hot spring warriors\" give Mizuki the warmest of welcomes, they also showed her their courage by valiantly facing down enemies who shared the same origins as the dark calamity that had once blighted her native land.Of all the people she met, Mualani in particular left a lasting impression. The first time they crossed paths, Mualani had been dashing about, playing tag with a group of children, when all of a sudden she had lost her footing — at which point, she accidentally crashed straight into Mizuki, then dragged her down together into the hot spring beside them. A somewhat clumsy first impression, by any account...Yet in the face of fearsome foes, Mualani's boundless optimism became an unshakable pillar of strength. Not only was she utterly dependable, but even after a fight, she showed no signs of the usual psychological scars that Mizuki had grown so accustomed to seeing.Spurred on by her curiosity, Mizuki investigated further, finally concluding that — aside from sheer willpower — a balanced lifestyle was crucial to mental well-being.Living their lives to the fullest in peacetime, brimming with energy and savoring every moment, and then stepping onto the battlefield without regrets, refreshed and ready for the fight — could this, Mizuki wondered, be the secret to the strength of Natlan's warriors?\"Play hard, fight hard, huh... Treating life's conundrums as you would challenges in a game — taking them on in a composed, timely manner.\"And thus, Mizuki conceived the idea of establishing an \"entertainment group.\" Her vision was to introduce the residents of Inazuma to a wide range of different leisure activities, and thereby significantly improve their mental well-being.From the People of the Springs, she got the idea of hot springs and water sports; from the Scions of the Canopy, of (relatively) safe extreme sports like rock climbing and mountaineering; and she even planned to set up fitness centers staffed by professional trainers from the Collective of Plenty. With a team of collaborators soon in place, Mizuki's vision began to take shape..."

    "text": "In Inazuman folklore, the yumekui-baku have always been celebrated for their benevolent and carefree nature, depicted as beings without wants of their own, yet ever ready to help others in need.Mizuki is a shining example of this in the flesh. Despite her extensive experience in helping others ward off nightmares, she has never capitalized on her reputation by increasing her fees, instead maintaining a remarkably lenient pricing policy.When treating the common folk, she calculates her labor fee by adhering to a strict formula — half of the patient's hourly wage multiplied by the duration of the session. Even when it amounts to no more than the price of a bowl of ramen, she accepts her meager earnings without a word of discontent.In Mizuki's eyes, these patients suffer enough as-is, so the least she can do is avoid adding financial burdens to their woes.For wealthier patients, she asks them to set their own price, saying, \"Given your means, what would you consider fair payment for this treatment?\"Whether out of respect for Mizuki or simply to uphold their own sense of pride, such patients invariably end up proposing handsome prices indeed...This approach has earned her services widespread acclaim, leading to a steady stream of appointments that keeps her so busy that she often goes for weeks without a single day off.After consuming a patient's nightmares, it always feels as if she has eaten a large bowl of rice. So long as the toxins are not too potent, both her youkai power and physical strength will be replenished.By all accounts, Mizuki seldom indulges in personal spending. Aside from a few simple outfits and the occasional inexpensive dessert, she rarely treats herself to anything, keeping her living expenses to a bare minimum.A youkai with practically no time off, almost no inclination to spend, nearly zero expenditure, and a relentless work ethic... Given several centuries, just how much could such an individual save up? Without any precedents to compare her against, it's a tough question to answer.No matter how you arrive at your estimate, one thing is for certain — that her savings must be substantial, to say the very least. And they were, in fact, the foundation that underpinned Mizuki's own investments.For a time, the turmoil caused by the Sakoku Decree prevented her from returning to Inazuma, leaving her unable to inspect the progress that had been made on the Aisa Bathhouse. Several of her other ventures, too, remained stuck at the planning stage, with no hope of headway in sight...Yet during this period, Mizuki was far from idle. She worked tirelessly to keep abreast of all the latest trends in Teyvat, ensuring that her future businesses could cater to all age groups and alleviate the troubles of patients young and old.Inspired by modern theories, she strove to make the process less daunting for her patients by stripping it of its overtly \"clinical\" characteristics. She referred to her patients as \"guests\" and rebranded the serious business of therapy as a form of leisure, meticulously refining every detail to foster an atmosphere of complete relaxation.Upon returning to Inazuma, Mizuki applied the research findings she had acquired in Fontaine, personally starring in a series of innovative new \"promotional programs\" designed to catapult her reputation to new heights.Despite having plenty of awkward moments in front of the Kamera, and how she sometimes got so nervous that she could hardly catch her breath, she knew that if she could just convince people to try out her new approach to therapy — so they could put their worries behind them, once and for all — then it would all be worth it.But aside from her own publicity efforts, Mizuki just so happened to also know a fellow professional with great potential for collaboration.And that was none other than her old friend, Yae Miko — editor-in-chief of the cultural and artistic hub that was the Yae Publishing House."

    "text": "\"When helping patients cope with their anxiety, should the emphasis be on gradually guiding them to come face to face with the source of their mental struggles, or on offering reassurance, prioritizing the alleviation of their unease?\"\"When dispelling nightmares, is there any risk that the direct removal of negative emotions through prolonged reliance on youkai powers might lead to unintended side effects?\"\"If we can't help patients resolve their real-world problems, how can we ensure that they don't relapse?\"...Finally back from her century-long odyssey, Mizuki had so much to discuss with her old friend Miko.Beneath the sakura tree where they used to meet as children, they spread out a tablecloth, laid out some snacks, and held a little tea party, chatting from dawn until dusk.Their elation at being reunited was accompanied by a rational exchange of ideas, giving them both a chance to share their heartfelt thoughts.Miko was of the opinion that entertainment must stay pure and simple, just as it was in essence. If patients could actively seek out happiness and fill their minds with vibrant, positive thoughts, they might very well be able to eliminate any possible foothold for negative emotions to take root.Mizuki, however, was concerned that focusing solely on the \"pursuit of happiness\" without addressing the core of a patient's struggles could lead to an emotional imbalance.As the tea party came to an amicable close, they both accepted the other's perspective, understanding that, in their own unique way, they would each come up with novel solutions to help the people of Inazuma overcome their inner demons.As Mizuki saw it, the Yae Publishing House's approach — focused mainly on light novels while branching off into various other forms of cultural entertainment — immersed customers in a myriad of fantastical worlds, injecting hope and vitality back into their lives.The issue, however, was that cultural products required a certain level of engagement. People who were too physically, mentally, or emotionally drained might struggle to muster the energy or concentration required for extended reading and contemplation.On top of this, if a person was to completely lose themselves in the fantasy world of light novels, they might inadvertently begin to overlook pressing real-world issues.The entertainment group that Mizuki had envisioned would not only address the challenges faced by the yumekui-baku, but also fill in this missing piece of the puzzle—Firstly, healing those who had neither the time nor the energy to enjoy more demanding forms of cultural entertainment and helping them find new joys in life.And secondly, helping those who had become lost in escapism by gently guiding their focus back to their inner selves.In this way, people from all walks of life in Inazuma — from hardworking common folk to learned literati — could be aided in finding a holistic solution for improving their spiritual well-being, regardless of their wealth or status.In cases where the patient's mental and emotional struggles were so deep-seated that they could not be alleviated through conventional methods, or with particularly delicate issues that required careful handling, Mizuki would fall back upon her baku powers to cleanse the toxic shadows from their dreams.Methodical, systematic, and seamless to a tee.That said, as ever, neighborhood gossip tended to focus on superficial details. Based on rumors from who knows where, word quickly went out that the major shareholder of Aisa Bathhouse, \"y'know, the one who just returned from abroad,\" was seeking to challenge the Yae Publishing House itself with a brand new business venture.The rumors grew increasingly sensational, even inspiring works like \"A Business Battle Between Childhood Friends\" which quickly became the talk of the town.When this tale reached Mizuki's ears, she was quite taken aback for a moment, but a smile quickly followed.Well, that... didn't sound like such a bad idea.Miko had always relished this type of fun, and it was indeed true that Mizuki felt determined to push forward in her career, eager to surpass the friend who had once strode ahead of her.With mutual understanding, the two friends became tacitly-acknowledged \"business rivals.\""

    "text": "Wherever Mizuki goes, her two little baku companions are never far behind. Indeed, they are practically inseparable.In her day-to-day life, the two little baku act like her assistants, helping Mizuki make drinks, cook meals, and fetch things that she requires.When she's busy fighting off monsters and knaves, not only will they cheer her on, they'll even jump in to join the fray...Mizuki calls them \"Ya-chan\" and \"Te-chan,\" simple yet meaningful names that carry connotations of \"emotional stability\" and \"rational thinking.\"They are not, however, Mizuki's kin, but rather manifestations of her youkai powers and embodiments of her spirit and wisdom.Clinical psychologists absorb their patients' sorrows, anxieties, and fears, yet their own negative emotions often go unaddressed. Over time, their beleaguered hearts put them at risk of a total and irrevocable breakdown.Mizuki has seen colleagues fall apart completely. Seeing them lying there immobile — some not only bedridden, but even mentally incapacitated — she quietly warned herself never to follow that same path.For this reason, Mizuki also conducts therapy on herself.Picture a version of her, overflowing with emotion, who could empathize with patients as naturally as drawing breath, yet whose own mood was as fragile as gossamer, collapsing at the slightest touch...Then imagine another version of her who, guided purely by reason, applied logic to every problem, stripping away all subjective emotions to the point of seeming somewhat cold and detached...The two little baku, embodying these two different aspects of Mizuki's self, each have their own flaws. As they accompany her when she is treating patients, they offer analyses from the most extreme of perspectives, not even stinting to outline the full consequences that such extremes would entail.Afterwards, Mizuki comforts the two of them as if gazing into mirrors of opposing natures, giving her a chance to pick apart the easily overlooked yet potentially devastating issues lying dormant within her own heart.When contemplating certain issues, if she starts to feel too fragile, she adopts the mindset of someone with a broader perspective by summoning up a degree of cold detachment...When communicating with someone, if she finds their mood worsening as a result of her coming across too harshly, she can also take a step back and start again from an empathetic perspective — and by doing this, she can strike a balance between objective logic and subjective emotions.This process of communicating with Ya-chan and Te-chan also plays a pivotal role in how Mizuki balances her own emotions.After having been through centuries of refinement and observing countless patient interactions, Ya-chan and Te-chan's perspectives no longer dwell at the opposite poles of emotion and reason. Much like Mizuki herself, they can now find a middle ground between the two — most of the time, at least.The day that Ya-chan's excessive empathy no longer easily ends in tears, and Te-chan learns not to dish out sharp critiques of overly subjective patients, will be the day that Mizuki has become nigh-impervious to even the most powerful of negative emotions."

    "text": "Even the most delicious of dishes, if eaten three times a day, every day, for hundreds or even thousands of meals in a row, would become unbearable for your average person.Yet in Mizuki's world of dream-cuisine, bland nightmares are a blessing to be savored.Some people's nightmares are like the apocalyptic aftermath of a kitchen explosion — a chaotic mix of seasonings with acrid undertones of charred woodsmoke, a slight tang of rust, and harsh, acidic notes to round it all off.But what about good dreams?Very few yumekui-baku even know what they taste like, for their kind follow an unwritten rule: \"Never eat someone else's good dreams without permission.\"It wasn't until her tenth year as a clinical psychologist that Mizuki finally had the rare privilege of tasting such a precious delicacy.One day, a girl who had made a full recovery thanks to Mizuki's therapy came to express her gratitude with a gift. As they chatted, the girl suddenly suggested the idea of sharing one of her colorful, vibrant dreams.It was a dreamscape brimming with innocence, energy, and dazzling fantasy. Mizuki was utterly captivated by its flavor... Pleasant, warm, and delicately sweet.From that day on, Mizuki developed a love for all kinds of desserts, and soon, a bold idea began to take root in her heart.Could the indescribable beauty of a good dream be a remedy in itself, powerful enough to dissolve negative emotions all on its own?If she could create such dreams with her youkai powers, they might serve as a potent medicine for her patients' emotional struggles.And maybe, just maybe... they could also be treasured as exquisite delicacies, a treat for herself, every now and then?Sadly, however, the baku do not possess the power of creation. Good dreams are, in a sense, the pure and untainted projections of a person's desires. As such, they cannot easily be replicated by outside forces, let alone conjured out of thin air...Since everyone's desires differ, there can be no universal \"recipe\" for creating a one-size-fits-all sweet dream. Attempting to probe a person's innermost thoughts — to fathom their deepest secrets — might itself become an act of intrusion, only adding to their anxiety and unease.Regrettably, therefore, Mizuki was unable to figure out the secret to creating a cure-all dream.But fortunately, the decades of searching and studying were not in vain. Her dedication was eventually rewarded...One weary yet fulfilling night, Mizuki dreamt of becoming a little baku once more, and of sharing a meal with her dearest friend by a ramen stall.This particular dream had a delicate, smoky feel to it, almost like a gentle breeze, and it seemed to share the same outline that many happy dreams had in common.Unbound, unburdened, and carefree...As the dream unfolded, a radiant, crystalline Vision silently appeared by Mizuki's pillow.From then on, Mizuki took a new approach, as if she had been inspired.She resolved to guide people towards tranquil, soothing dreams, rekindling memories of the things they treasured most.She believed that all the good and beauty that people cherished deep inside them would surely awaken at crucial moments, coloring their dreams and transforming them into the most magnificent forms imaginable."

And, based on what I've heard, many people without a Vision are waiting on the same miracle to happen to them.But, dreaming of something unobtainable often means setting yourself up for greater disappointment, especially when you wake up, and reality sets in.Sometimes, in the pursuit of a mirage, we inadvertently turn reality into a nightmare from which we must escape... I can only hope that doesn't happen to them."

But once he had a few Mora in the pot from his performance, you could be sure he would hurry off to spend it at the same place every time — one of the city's taverns.Unfortunately for Venti, his childlike appearance meant that his attempts to acquire alcohol failed at every turn.The first time he was refused service, he was heard grumbling: \"I'm sure there were no such preposterous regulations last time I was here...\" Once he realized that the same rule applied to all taverns in town, he decided he would have to change his approach...The strategy he developed was drinking on the job — that is to say, playing the lyre while holding a wine cup in his mouth, urging his audience to buy him a drink from the bar if they liked his performances instead of giving him Mora.The novelty of this made him quite popular in Mondstadt.There was just one snag — he couldn't help but sneeze if a cat came close...And if he happened to be holding a wine cup in his mouth when it happened... needless to say, it would spell disaster.Venti, therefore, has one golden rule when selecting a spot to perform, and that is that there must be no cats in the vicinity.Easier said than done — the stray cats of Mondstadt seem to be quite drawn to him."

In fact, the only visible proof of his connection with Mondstadt is the Statues of The Seven that appear across the land — even then, the resemblance is vague at best. Fortunately, Barbatos's past deeds are recorded in books and epics, sung and passed on by the bards.In contrast to these more canonical works, Venti's ballads tend to include bizarre adventures and acts of mischief, such as the time that Barbatos pinched the Cryo Archon's scepter and replaced it with a hilichurl's wooden club...Worshippers of Barbatos are quick to decry these frivolous tales as blasphemous fabrications. But whenever someone confronts Venti about this, his response suggests that he has not an ounce of remorse.\"How can you know that they're fabrications?\"He has a point — even the most devoted sister could not possibly know the details of all of Barbatos's deeds from a millennium ago.Only Venti knows the truth behind his song lyrics, and it is a truth he hides behind an enigmatic smile.Reason being, yes — Venti's tall tales of Barbatos's unorthodox exploits are entirely fabricated.Hey, Venti finds that a few drinks really gets his muse going.

The wind's ceaseless howling ground the soil and the rock of that city into smooth, flowing dust.The Lord of Wind who lived in his high tower was Decarabian, God of Storms. He squinted from on high at his subjects, who bowed before him in the unceasing wind, and, believing them submissive, thought this good.In those days, Venti was but a single thread of the thousand winds that roared through the northern lands.He who would in latter days be known as \"Barbatos\" was but a tiny elemental spirit, without a shred of divine dignity, a breeze that brought subtle changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope.In Mondstadt of old, Venti met a young boy. This lad knew how to play the lyre, and longed to write the greatest poem of all.\"I do so wish to see the birds in flight.\"So said the boy who had never seen the blue sky, eagles, or the green grass, his voice almost utterly drowned by the wind.\"Friend, will you not come along?\""

The Anemo Archon Barbatos felt power flowing at his fingertips.His first use of this power was to reconstitute himself in the likeness of that young lad.For only if he wore human shape could he play the lyre that the lad so loved.Plucking its strings, he scattered the ice and snow and split the mountains with a divine wind.He bade Mondstadt become a city of freedom, a nation without a king.In future, he believed, it would become a better, more romantic city.\"Surely, he too would have wanted to live in such a place.\"Thus, a new age began for Mondstadt."

But he had never imagined that those to whom he had gifted freedom would make for themselves a tyrant.The aristocracy ruled Mondstadt with a cruel hand, bringing slaves into this land and ignoring the cries of the oppressed.Thus the Anemo Archon returned after these 1,600 years to what was once the City of Freedom. He heard the cry of the slave girl Vennessa, and together with her raised a rebellion that overthrew the aristocracy.—Now, the above is what all know to be the official history of Mondstadt.The story has an interesting, little-known twist, however.The one who united the people of Mondstadt in this conflict was indeed the hero Vennessa — but that which caused many of the aristocracy's troops to turn coat was a \"treachery against the wind.\"A secret treaty was found, a betrayal of the city — the aristocrats had forsaken the wind, and sold everything in Mondstadt to the Geo Archon of the neighboring land.At the treaty's end was carved an insignia inimitable by all save the deity so named: Rex Lapis.How the soldiers that had once oppressed the slaves shuddered when they saw that they too would become slaves in a foreign land.The news, and the conflict, spread like wildfire, consuming the aristocracy. It was only many years later that historians would discover that this treaty was fake.As it turned out, Venti had once practiced the art of forgery in order to play pranks on the Geo Archon, but could never deceive the god of wealth and transactions.

She was not born with beak and claw, so she would arm herself with stones in their place.<!--\n              -->All too eager to attempt a hunt of her own, she wandered the woods until at last, her first mighty foe came forth — a foraging Forest Boar.<!--\n              -->Imitating the Qucusaurs' movements, she leaped at the boar, only to be sent spinning to the ground by its fierce charge.<!--\n              -->Rolling to her feet, she snatched up a nearby rock and hurled it, only for the boar to dodge.<!--\n              -->Ultimately, she was forced to return empty-handed, her whole body ragged, covered head to toe in injuries and abrasions.<!--\n              -->Her mother brought herbs to treat her, and her sister vigorously opposed any future forays.<!--\n              -->Chasca agreed to stay and heal in the nest, but dove into the mountains the instant her wounds closed.<!--\n              -->She shuttled between forest and stream, collecting all manner of odds and ends to use: Sharp-edged stones, sturdy sticks, sticky sap, the skins of dead animals...<!--\n              -->Her family did not quite understand the purpose of all this \"junk,\" but thought Chasca having a new hobby was a good thing nonetheless.<!--\n              -->They never imagined she would use them to fashion a new weapon — a slingshot made from sticks and skin, all the better for shooting stones both faster and further.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->The Forest Boar had a little squirrel cornered, yet what it had not realized was that it too had entered another's hunting grounds.<!--\n              -->Without warning, it found something stuck to its hooves, and it struggled in vain to get free. Then, several sharp objects, whistling through the air, struck its skull one after another.

I know I agreed to take an orphan in... but, you didn't say it was an orphaned Qucusaurus!\"<!--\n              -->Given the frequency with which Natlan faces Abyssal invasions, it was not uncommon for war orphans to be adopted, but one like Chasca, abandoned by humans and adopted by Saurians... That was the stuff of legends, and legends alone.<!--\n              -->As events would prove, Cusco had in fact underestimated the destructive might of this \"Qucusaurus.\" Qucusaurs were already well-known for doing things their own ways, but Chasca's temper would prove harder to restrain than even the proudest among that race of Saurians.<!--\n              -->\"That vulture!

To obtain food perhaps, or to defend their territory... but little Chasca seemed set on kicking up trouble for its own sake. She had food far more delicious than raw meat set before her at the table, and her bed was far softer than a roost of straw, but still she would constantly stir up conflict, day and night.<!--\n              -->This really had Cusco's brows all knitted up.

But what was the root of it?<!--\n              -->Humans would die for money, and monsters for food, but this?

If you never speak up, no one will ever understand.\"<!--\n              -->\"The hell are you even asking her for, Cusco? This vulture can't even say a single damn word!

One day, it'd be to go see an elder living in seclusion; the next, to gather a legendary herb.<!--\n              -->Each time, one of them would have the other stay behind to keep an eye on things, but when emergencies cropped up, they would both rush off in a hurry, leaving young Chuychu behind with an \"elder sister\" who was mentally younger than her.<!--\n              -->Fortunately, Chasca appeared to have become much better behaved since learning the word \"vulture.\" At least now, when she had some minor disagreement with someone, she could open up with some insults rather than going straight to delivering a beating.<!--\n              -->Perhaps, Chuychu could not help but wonder, Chasca had even realized that no one would apologize for her and clean up her messes while their parents were gone.<!--\n              -->...Probably not. With her personality, there was no way she knew how much their parents worried for her... or how well they treated her.<!--\n              -->Chuychu had once imagined what life would be like if she had an elder sister — a playmate, a sharer of woes, someone to care for her when she fell ill...<!--\n              -->But since Chasca had arrived, her father had become so busy, and her mother's free time had evaporated. Even those her age who she used to play with now avoided her, intentionally or not.<!--\n              -->This was all Chasca's fault—<!--\n              -->Chuychu shook her head frantically as that thought flashed through it.<!--\n              -->No. She couldn't think like that. The elders said that the tribe must be united, and her parents had also said that Chasca actually really deserved their sympathy...<!--\n              -->...But if she weren't around...<!--\n              -->\"Hey! You home, Cusco? Chasca got into another fight!\"<!--\n              -->The sudden commotion cut that train of thought short.<!--\n              -->She rushed to the scene in place of her father, only to find Chasca, her face the very picture of fury, alongside a group of wailing children, among whom were many of her former friends.<!--\n              -->\"These... vul...\" Chasca lifted her hand to point at the pile of crying children.<!--\n              -->\"Another fight? Really!?\" The thoughts that Chuychu had just dispelled came blazing back. \"You're always like this. That's why... That's why they don't play with me anymore! That's why Mom and Dad don't spend time with me anymore!\"<!--\n              -->\"Vul... tures...\" Chasca unconsciously lowered her pointing hand, and though her mouth still repeated those words in grunts, her voice grew quieter and quieter.<!--\n              -->\"You're the worst vulture here!\"<!--\n              -->At last, the words Chuychu had hidden in her heart tore forth.<!--\n              -->Chasca's eyes widened, her lips quivering as if to say something. Then, she finally cast her eyes to the ground, turned, and ran off in the direction of the wilderness outside the tribe.<!--\n              -->...She'll be alright, Chuychu thought. This isn't the first time she's run off. They just needed to go look for her later.<!--\n              -->But for some reason, deep down, she felt a sense of unease.<!--\n              -->\"What happened back there with Chasca? She seemed much better lately... What did you all say to set her off?\" An adult who had arrived on the scene muttered.<!--\n              -->The children who had been beaten looked at one another, hesitant to speak. A moment later, someone raised their hand, and said with a trembling voice:<!--\n              -->\"We... It was just an argument at first! But then, someone said...\"<!--\n              -->\"Someone said that Uncle Cusco and his whole family... were also idiots for... keeping this vulture in our tribe... We were just joking, I swear! A—And we heard that from the adults!\"<!--\n              -->\"And they also said not to play with Chuychu... just in case her sister's sickness is contagious...\"<!--\n              -->Shocked, Chuychu whirled around, facing the direction Chasca had disappeared in.<!--\n              -->But there was nothing between the mountains save the mournful wind, giving howling voice to some cry for which there could be no words."

I'll go back to my nest.'<!--\n              -->'Mom might chase me out again, but Sister will speak for me.'<!--\n              -->'The \"sickness\" hurts. But it can hurt all it wants. I don't need humans to \"cure\" me.'<!--\n              -->Such were the chaotic thoughts that swirled through her mind.<!--\n              -->Well-practiced leaps carried her aloft from tree to tree as she drunk in the fresh, familiar mountain air and scent of the leaves. Still, she could not forget the flickering fires of the tribe's candles.<!--\n              -->'I don't need fires to keep warm. I don't need fire to light up the night. Mom and Sister never did either.'<!--\n              -->'Humans are weak. They fear the cold night, so they light fires. Proud, strong Saurians don't need that.'<!--\n              -->...And yet, the fire was so warm.<!--\n              -->These cowardly thoughts stole into her mind, and suddenly, they echoed and rang, stopping her cold with a splitting headache. She plummeted out of the trees.<!--\n              -->—\"It\" was here again.<!--\n              -->Gritting her teeth, Chasca pulled herself up against the tree, her trembling fingers scratching bloody trails across the branches.<!--\n              -->'Fight. Bite. Destroy. That way, you can forget all your unhappiness.'<!--\n              -->'Forget the cowardliness this brief stay has forced upon you. Forget those chains that the human world has bound you with, all their rules. All things were born wild! Born beasts!'<!--\n              -->She had heard that voice for as long as she could remember. At first, it had merely guided her to hunt, to bite into her prey. But then, it came more frequently, its noise leaving her dizzy and faint, release only coming after she gave in and made a mess.<!--\n              -->'Mom sent me to the humans... hoping that they could cure me, didn't she?'<!--\n              -->'But it's no use. The human world is noisier than the nest. Humans disagree and fight all day. They are always in conflict. And \"its\" voice gets clearer when they fight. More tempting.'<!--\n              -->'—Sister, I don't want to disappoint Mom, but...'<!--\n              -->Chasca had tried to confide in her elder sister on several occasions, but alas, her human tongue could not make the vocalizations of a Qucusaurus.<!--\n              -->'—And you, I know you all don't want me to fight, but...'<!--\n              -->Chasca had also tried to communicate with Cusco and his wife, but a Qucusaur child could not form human words.<!--\n              -->'—They deserved that beating! They scolded me! They scolded you, too!'<!--\n              -->Chasca had tried to explain herself to Chuychu, but only that tattered word, \"vulture,\" came stumbling out of her mouth.<!--\n              -->'Never mind them! I can hear you, and you can hear me. That is all you need!'<!--\n              -->'No need to explain. No need to understand! Just break everything that hurts you! Tear apart all that stands in your way!'<!--\n              -->Even now, that voice screamed in her head, rounding on her.<!--\n              -->'—Enough! You're the one I hate the most! You're the biggest, the worst, the most loathsome vulture of them all!'<!--\n              -->Chasca all but roared as she pounded, pounded, pounded her fists against the tree, as if she might rip that voice out and bash it into a pulp!<!--\n              -->Splinters of bark and leaf sprayed out every which way, swirling in the air, but \"it\" laughed all the more wildly.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Moon-silver pierced through the trees, its mottled gleam lighting Chasca's pallid face.<!--\n              -->She collapsed, her fists a mess of split skin and muddied flesh, exposing the white bone beneath in some spots.<!--\n              -->Everything hurt. She could not move. Her eyelids were so, so heavy. Even the voice in her head was all but spent.<!--\n              -->'Of course it would be. \"It\" is dying, because \"it\" is me.'<!--\n              -->'This isn't far from the human tribe, and there's so much tree cover. Mom and Sister won't be able to find me, will they?'<!--\n              -->Cusco and his wife were out. There was no way they'd return in time to find someone who'd run away from home.<!--\n              -->No one would know that Chasca was about to die here.<!--\n              -->...And that was fine. One less vulture in the world, Chasca forced herself to think — not to mention the even bigger vulture within.<!--\n              -->...The moonlight was a little too cold after all, though.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Dimly, she felt some warmth on her face, like the light cover of Mom's wings, like the light of human candles. Chasca opened her eyes slowly.<!--\n              -->Before her was a humble bonfire, and a young girl squatting and tending it carefully — Chuychu.<!--\n              -->\"...Ah!\" Realizing that Chasca was awake, Chuychu hastily hid her hands behind her back. In the firelight, Chasca could see that her hands had been slightly burned.<!--\n              -->\"...Are your hands okay?\" Chuychu deflected.<!--\n              -->Only then did Chasca notice the bandages wrapped snugly around her hands. It was clumsy work, but enough to stop the bleeding.<!--\n              -->\"...I couldn't move you, so I had to make do here... But I've lit a fire, so the adults should find us soon enough.\"<!--\n              -->Chasca did not answer, but the question her eyes asked was clear.<!--\n              -->\"...Well, Mom and Dad would be sad if something happened to you.\"<!--\n              -->\"...\"<!--\n              -->\"Also...

Let's go home, okay?\"<!--\n              -->\"...Home...\" Chasca broke her silence, mumbling the new word she had just learned. Then she nodded. \"...Let's 'go home.'\""

    "text": "The first time the Flying Captain, Elder Allpa, came forward to teach Chasca, it was because her front door had been virtually blocked up by the deluge of complaints about Chasca and the beatings she'd handed out.\nBut no matter how long Allpa spent laboring over explanations of the human world and its laws, little Chasca could never understand what was wrong with fighting.<!--\n              -->Saurians and beasts all decided things through strength. She'd won the fight, so why was she the one being questioned?<!--\n              -->Allpa would talk and gesticulate, while Chasca would study her, wondering if she might be spared the lengthy lectures if she could simply defeat the Elder.<!--\n              -->But the second time she came to give Chasca guidance, she immediately realized that there was something different about the girl's gaze.<!--\n              -->\"...Teach me. Become strong.\" With those choppy words, Chasca asked to learn human ways. \"Abyss... want to defeat.\"<!--\n              -->\"...Alright. In that case, let me teach you to use humanity's greatest weapon.\"<!--\n              -->So saying, Allpa grabbed a woven scroll, an exquisite line of small words embroidered at its head: \"Peacemaker — the Art of Communication.\"<!--\n              -->\"Our greatest weapon is our language.\"<!--\n              -->But what did flapping one's lips have to do with strength? Chasca did not quite understand.<!--\n              -->She would rather learn how to use various weapons, from bows to guns, or perhaps how to use Phlogiston, or how to shoot while in the air.<!--\n              -->If one was strong enough, talk could be dispensed with... That was how she had thought in the past, at least.<!--\n              -->But still, she had not been able to tear that voice from her heart and beat it until it stopped talking ever again.<!--\n              -->So she endured, learning every last word that Allpa taught her, chewing on that woven scroll that she never thought she would read, bit by bit, line by line.<!--\n              -->As it turned out, when she learned to communicate, coordinate, and rely on others, the efficiency of her hunts seemed to increase — just as the scroll had said.<!--\n              -->When she wrote Chuychu a letter on her birthday and wished her well, she and their parents seemed pleasantly surprised — just as the scroll had said.<!--\n              -->And when she took part in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, bearing the expectations of all on her shoulders, it seemed as if the people of the Flower-Feather Clan looked upon her with a little more respect — just as the scroll had said.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->\"Here you go. The highest possible caliber, and the greatest possible mobility... If this request had come from anyone else, from someone whose abilities I wasn't so sure of, I'd have used the materials they gave me to beat some sense into them.\"<!--\n              -->\"Thanks, Xilonen. This should make me a more persuasive mediator.\" Upon receiving the almost comically huge \"Soulsniper: Ritual Staff,\" Chasca tested its weight using the reins in her hand.<!--\n              -->\"I'll say... Who'd disagree with you after being hit with this thing, anyway? This has to be the strongest weapon I've ever made for your tribe.\"<!--\n              -->\"...No, 'a bullet has the most power when it has yet to leave the chamber.'\"<!--\n              -->As she caressed the cylinder of the gun, this analogy that Chasca had encountered in a certain woven scroll came back to her, unbidden.<!--\n              -->\"The strongest weapon, huh... Then, from this day forth, we shall be the 'Peacemakers.'\""

Yet this feeling was also familiar, like that of an infant returning to their mother's embrace.<!--\n              -->She had once been abandoned. Was this where she had always belonged?<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->But just as she was about to touch that apparition, voices filled with warmth called out from behind her.<!--\n              -->\"Hey, Sis.

I was so exhausted that I fell asleep even before she did.Then she wrote a whole maintenance guide, which she forced me to learn by heart so I wouldn't come bugging her with issues every day...

No, no, that would make her seem like some unemployed bum with neither skill in word or deed.Perhaps she should go get a certification, then.

Could it be that high-class culinary exams also taught people how to cook Lavender Melons a certain way?Faced with such a question, Shinobu put the melon she was grilling down before slowly telling a story.At that time, she had gone to far-off Liyue to study law, and would visit this place known as Wanmin Restaurant in her free time.The food there was incredibly diverse and made in unique ways, with ingenious ideas that surprised her, despite the fact that she had already obtained a high-level culinary license at the time.From slivers of stir-fried meat immersed in sauce to boiled cabbage with the fragrance of chicken soup... Indeed, the world was wide and full of wonders.And though one might be acquainted with every profession and be certified highly in every one, it is never wise to rest on one's laurels. Indeed, it is only by daring to try and make breakthroughs that one can surpass the limits set down by those who came before.The Arataki Gang did not understand this in full, but they cheered all the same, for there was no harm in that — and their cheers certainly did the melons' flavor little harm.Seeing how they greatly enjoyed their meals, Shinobu kept the ending of the story to herself.Back then, the sous chef of Wanmin Restaurant had heard her say these words, and had urged Chef Mao to bring out the Salt and Pepper Slime...Such food, she knew, would never appear in any culinary exam anywhere in the world.Nor would the Arataki Gang want to learn that Shinobu had slathered slime ooze onto Lavender Melons as sauce before grilling them..."

    "text": "The Kuki Clan is a family of shrine maidens, a tradition that spans generations. Members of that family regard service to Narukami as a great honor.This too was the case with her generation. After her sister Miyuki was sent to the Grand Shrine, she was also sent there from a young age as an understudy.Of course, a great store of rules and regulations came with this time-honored tradition: for example, how many days to fast to show one's sincerity and resolve, or how many ablutions were to be performed to avoid profaning the divine...No one ever explained where these rules had come from or how they had been decided. She was simply told that they had existed since way back, and thus were to be followed.When Shinobu first arrived at the shrine, she would sometimes catch a chill from staying on the mountain at night. At this time, her family lived far from the shrine and her sister was out on an errand far afield.A strong-willed child, she did not ask the other shrine maidens for help, but would instead pluck thorned plants one by one, alone, before twining them around her body.According to a traditional saying, this deed would earn you the protection of Narukami and remove the illness from you. So she went on twining that loop of thorns, even as she whispered prayers to Narukami for protection deep into the night, shivering all the while.However, when the night was over, her chill was not cured. All she had earned instead was a tingling red mark around herself.As the days passed, Shinobu would find again and again that the rules were not as foolproof as the ancients might have made them out to be, nor was the role of a shrine maiden quite as indispensable as they had claimed back home.Well then, didn't that mean that the very necessity of the Kuki Clan to become shrine maidens was also up for renegotiation?Some years later, Shinobu had already left the shrine for some time now, and with time to kill, she would flip through a book on herbology.Within its pages, she found that it clearly, indeed vividly, described how the mountainous thorns had paralytic properties that could render birds and beasts unable to move, and that it was this property that led the ancients to include them into medicine to ameliorate topical aches and pains.She was, well... speechless.Shinobu thought to herself that yes, perhaps rules did have rhyme or reason behind them, but to treat the rules as reason in themselves must be treated as an obsolete practice.On further reflection, she could not help but feel that she was happier living her current life."

The job itself was no challenge to Shinobu, bearer of an advanced certification in this field, but the address of the client was... well, a little special.When she brought the newly-maintained figurine to the Police Station, she ran into a petty thief who was making their escape from that site who, fleeing at all speed as they were, rammed right into her, sending the doll sailing into the air.Seeing that several days' work was about to go down the gutter, Shinobu struck out like lightning, seizing the figurine with one hand before whirling about and tripping the suspect.All at once the surrounding people surged forward, subduing the crook. Afterward, Kujou Sara — seemingly the person who had placed this order — would come and thank her personally.As for the goods, they were perfectly unharmed, much to Sara's surprise — to think that someone in the lacquerware business could have such martial skill!After learning of Shinobu's circumstances and her desire to \"find a job that gives her real freedom,\" Sara would consider for a moment before inviting Shinobu to join the Tenryou Commission.\"Hmm... No, I think I'll pass. The civil service seems a bit too limiting for me...\" At this point, Shinobu hesitated. \"But if those legal lectures and martial arts training could be done part-time, I will definitely consider the offer.\"From that day on, Shinobu would begin a new slew of part-time work.One thing did surprise her, though — the general of the Tenryou Commission would always attend her lectures and demonstrations.\"It is only right that those who enforce the law should better understand it,\" so Sara said with perfect earnestness.\"The opportunity to test myself against similarly-skilled warriors is also not one I get often,\" Shinobu replied.Sara's straightforward personality and decisive behavior were things Shinobu greatly approved of, and it was through this — and through Sara hiring her often to maintain figurines — that the two would quickly become friends.Sara would also repeat her offer of employment several times, only for Shinobu to decline each time. Yet, this \"job that brings true freedom\" was not something she would find, either.That is, until one day, when Sara wound up arriving late to the izakaya where they had arranged, as they often did, to meet and have figurines change hands, leaving Shinobu to drink till midnight.\"That's unexpected. I didn't think you could be late at all, Sara.\"\"Sorry. I was held up by a really rowdy gang...\"\"A gang? And what gang could have troubled you that much?\"\"Well, I wouldn't call them 'trouble' exactly. They call themselves the Arataki Gang...\""

Could this not also be the harbinger of worse incidents to come?Not to mention the Gang's daily operations... Other than logistics and transportation, home repair, and performance, they now added tax agency, legal consultation, event management and various other operations that both involved sizable capital investments and a not-insignificant air of danger to them.Surely they weren't intending to do all these things without the right licenses... right?And never mind the licenses, first — if they were to commit fraud in any of these newly-added businesses, they would surely be arrested by the Tenryou Commission!However, these wild guesses and ill-omened rumors would quickly be dispelled. The Arataki Gang's actions afterward were more than enough to show that they were still a gang of their word.Those who have attempted to enlist their new financial services have indeed seen their situations turned right around, and the transparency and uprightness of their processes have been stunning.Of course, it is also a pity that the Gang remains the Gang. The children of Hanamizaka still live in fear of Arataki Itto coming to win their snacks off them come dinner time, and often still return to their homes fuming.In any case, it seems that even this legendary second-in-command will take a long time to reform the Arataki Gang's more... unbound ways."

For you guys, anyway.\"The talks were going exactly as Shinobu expected, until a passing child suddenly pointed at her, exclaiming:\"Mama, mama, look! That's the shrine maiden who never smiled back at the Grand Shrine! Wow, she looks so cool!\"The child was whisked away by her panicked mother, but the quick departure did not change the mottled embarrassment and resignation on her face, as if she could not wait to flee for the hills and forests right that instant.As for Itto's face, it was as if two onikabuto were wrestling for dominance upon it. Genta and the others, try as they might, ultimately lost their poker faces amidst gales of guffaws.The next martial demonstration would, of course, see their faces beaten so hard that they were redder than Shinobu's was at that moment. If only they had known their fate, perhaps they might not have laughed quite so hard.From that day on, Shinobu would sport that mask. Pitch-black and claws bared, it lent her a positively demonic aspect.By the way, it was also that martial demonstration that served as the origin of her moniker \"the demonic deputy\"."

But...\"<!--\n              -->\"Meaning that the key is to study hard, then put what you've learned into practice.\"<!--\n              -->But before she could even finish imparting her words of wisdom, the children had already scampered off, wearing dissatisfied pouts. Their wild yet simple imaginings had been disappointed, dropping to the ground like a balloon weighed down by a basket of obsidian. Until another such idea occurred to them, reviving their fantasies and carrying them off into the clouds, they would continue to learn — whether willingly or not.<!--\n              -->\"Heh, it's not like I was lying...\"<!--\n              -->The Name Engraver lay back down, shaded from the sunlight by a canopy of lush vegetation.

One by one, they would lean forward onto their desks and drift off to dreamland.<!--\n              -->Eventually, Xilonen would be the only student still awake. Under her tutor's approving gaze, she would even raise the notebook she was holding and ask questions of her own.<!--\n              -->\"Do Phlogiston Engravings rely on phlogiston flow to operate? If I were to dive into a pool of pure phlogiston, would the engraving diagrams on my body activate, shut down, or blow up?\"<!--\n              -->\"Does phlogiston exist in a gaseous state?

Yet to ensure that she passed her exams on such subjects, she would \"bribe\" her classmates with milk candies, getting them to lend her their notes. She would proceed to copy it all down, then force herself to memorize everything, just to get a score that would not raise eyebrows.<!--\n              -->Her strength and her passion lay not in empty fantasies, but rather in precise axioms and equations. As far as she saw it, these were the only things that would benefit future generations; these were the things that were worth studying.<!--\n              -->As for those stories... Well, they were neither accurate nor concise, lacked both definitions and axioms, and were simply too chaotic to follow. They held no value for her beyond the points they were worth on the exam papers.<!--\n              -->Despite seeing all of this, Teyiz chose not to immediately stop Xilonen, nor did she tell her off.<!--\n              -->But when the next class was about to begin, and Xilonen got ready to roll out one of her usual excuses — like having a stomachache, or feeling dizzy, or catching a cold — Teyiz cut right through them, one and all.<!--\n              -->\"I once thought the same way as you do, Xilonen.\"<!--\n              -->Thus did the kindly Name Engraver address her student, patting the notebook of equations that she held.<!--\n              -->\"But remember — for us Name Engravers, stories and equations are, in essence, one and the same.\""

Natlan is an ocean of heroic legends, and perhaps there really is no way to verify such stories.\"<!--\n              -->\"Through generations of oral tradition, countless stories have been twisted or exaggerated, focusing on one person's great achievements, while secretly diminishing another's...\"<!--\n              -->\"But one day, it will be you that holds the forge hammer, and you will be the one tasked with forging the heroic deeds of those who have gone before into Ancient Names.\"<!--\n              -->\"When that day comes, if the heroic deeds you are to engrave are likewise the subject matter of countless unverified tales, and the focus of unstemmed controversy and debate...\"<!--\n              -->\"How then will you strike the hammer?

For her tribe, the passing of this Name Engraver did not come as a surprise.<!--\n              -->She had grown old, and often told those looking after her that she could hear the whispers of the Wayob in her dreams.<!--\n              -->But she said that she couldn't leave just yet, as there were still things she needed to pass on — once she had found the right person, of course. She could not answer the Wayob's call until that time had come.<!--\n              -->\"...With the blood of this land.\"<!--\n              -->\"Burn away all impurities, and souls gather in the fire.\"<!--\n              -->And with that, Xilonen let go of the torch, and the pyre began to roar.<!--\n              -->She stayed there the entire night. The next morning, she gathered her teacher's ashes into an urn and placed them in the cave she had always spoken of.<!--\n              -->Yet in the world outside, Teyiz's story scattered like a wild wind blowing through the valley.<!--\n              -->One person, for instance, claimed that he had been initiated into the true craft of forging Ancient Names by Teyiz herself, producing a signed book from her as proof. Another said that she had left them her workshop, showing the key as evidence. But Xilonen did not concern herself with such petty bickering, such maneuvering for personal gain. What troubled her more deeply were the more insidious lies.<!--\n              -->\"Apparently, when Teyiz taught the stories of our heroes, she would sometimes question their grounding in truth...\"<!--\n              -->\"So you heard that too? Good grief... It all sounds quite academic, but what about the children? Surely there's a risk of them being led astray?\"<!--\n              -->\"Exactly what I was thinking! And I also heard that when she was young, Teyiz concerned herself with nothing other than technical research. Should someone like that really have been teaching our young ones the right way to go about forging Ancient Names? Hmm...\"<!--\n              -->Through word of mouth, Teyiz's story was twisted beyond all recognition — one moment held up as a paragon of virtue and selflessness, the next as a pernicious schemer driven purely by ulterior motives. In one version, she was the hero; in the next, a petty villain.<!--\n              -->When people fail to grasp the wind, they instead begin to create for themselves a variety of boxes, then claimed that the wind was whatever shape they'd made.<!--\n              -->But the true story will only ever be — can only ever be — that dark, heavy stone.<!--\n              -->The next day, the tribespeople were shocked to see that Xilonen, usually so laid-back, seemed like a changed person. As if driven by an endless store of energy, she traveled all over the Children of Echoes' lands, interviewing everyone and anyone connected to Teyiz, reviewing every document she could find that mentioned her old teacher's name. Yet that wasn't enough for Xilonen. She left the tribe, consulting couriers from the Scions of the Canopy, meeting musicians from the People of the Springs, requesting access to the woven scrolls of the Masters of the Night-Wind, scaling the cliffs of the Flower-Feather Clan, stepping through the gates of the Collective of Plenty... With the utmost rigor and painstaking care, Xilonen meticulously recorded every single trace that Teyiz had left out there in the world.<!--\n              -->Not only were these documents what she needed to refute the slanderous stories and malicious rumors about Teyiz — they were enough to dismiss the strange titles that some had bestowed upon her too.<!--\n              -->What Xilonen wanted to leave behind was a true, unblemished version of Teyiz.<!--\n              -->Only flawless ores of the utmost strength could be refined, forged, and eventually tempered into something worthy of being handed down to posterity.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->\"Xilonen, why did you set out to become a Name Engraver in the first place? It all looks so tiring...\"<!--\n              -->Xilonen's hammer blows rang out loud as her apprentices watched her, resting their chins in the palms of their hands.<!--\n              -->Xilonen paused for a moment to wipe away the sweat from her brow.<!--\n              -->\"I never really did. But my father, my mother, my teacher... They all did before me. So what choice did I have?\"<!--\n              -->\"And besides...\"<!--\n              -->She raised her hammer once more.<!--\n              -->\"Someone has to shoulder the responsibility of telling stories, right?\""

    "text": "Given the choice, Xilonen would prefer making intricate practical tools over forging Ancient Names any day of the week. Things like compressed phlogiston sprayers that let you create Phlogiston Engravings at range, phlogiston-fueled wings that allow for vertical takeoff and landing, even super-size sniper rifles, custom-made for a certain someone...<!--\n              -->Yet among her many inventions, the one that the Children of Echoes have come to know best is without a doubt her specially modified \"Dance-Off Stage.\"<!--\n              -->At that time, the latest Drillbit Dance daily dance-off had just kicked off. Dancers took the stage one after another, the searing intensity of their moves and beats as hot as molten lava, driving both the audience and the performers themselves into a state of great excitement.<!--\n              -->But just as the contest reached its climax, the old Dance-Off Stage suddenly went haywire. The rhythm and sound became a total mess, making sharp, piercing noises that almost caused a dancer, who was just getting ready to attempt a particularly tricky move, to fall flat on their face. Below, the audience had their hands firmly clamped over their ears.<!--\n              -->Just as the stage technician began to scratch their head, at a complete loss for how to claw back this embarrassing situation, the music suddenly stabilized. The Dance-Off Stage was back in action; and hearing a languid voice say \"Testing, testing, one, two, three...\" the crowd's attention turned to Xilonen, who they saw holding a bundle of wires in one hand and propping up her chin in the other.<!--\n              -->\"Testing, testing... Can everyone hear me?\"<!--\n              -->Almost instinctively, the dancers nodded back.<!--\n              -->\"Good. Well, in that case, let's get started.\" Dropping the wires on the ground, Xilonen gave the blinking technician a pat as she sauntered past.<!--\n              -->\"Let me handle the next track for you too.\"<!--\n              -->\"Xilonen, you... y—you can DJ!?\"<!--\n              -->\"Just listen.\"<!--\n              -->No sooner had she finished speaking than a new melody, more powerful than any that had come before, began booming out from the stage. After a moment of stunned silence, the audience erupted, cheering even more enthusiastically than before.<!--\n              -->When the Drillbit Dance daily dance-off came to a close, the organizer paid Xilonen an official visit, hoping to convince her to accept the dual role of equipment consultant and special DJ of the Drillbit Dance contest, throwing in a more-than-generous compensation package to sweeten the deal.<!--\n              -->But Xilonen declined both titles and compensation, agreeing only to modify the Dance-Off Stage and any related equipment during her free time.<!--\n              -->As the conversation ended, the organizer scratched their head and asked:<!--\n              -->\"Xilonen, none of us had any idea you were such a good DJ... Where did you learn to do that?\"<!--\n              -->\"I picked up a few things when I went over to the People of the Springs to learn about record pressing, but I've been so busy that I've never had a chance to try them out. Want me to teach you a trick or two?\"<!--\n              -->\"No, no, no, it'll all just go in one ear and out the other...\" came the organizer's reply, batting off the idea with a vigorous wave of the hands. \"But seriously, don't you want anything in return? This is such a big ask, and besides, you're always so busy to start with.\"<!--\n              -->\"Well... I do have one request — if you'll consider it.\"<!--\n              -->\"Please, ask away!\"<!--\n              -->\"Once I don't have to forge Ancient Names anymore, let me come work for you as an official DJ.

    "text": "Where should the first hammerstroke fall?<!--\n              -->As Xilonen gripped the haft, preparing to get started on the first Ancient Name she had ever forged, she hesitated, unsure of how to strike.<!--\n              -->She had done plenty of research and prepared everything that was required. Just a few days before, she had followed a mining team from the tribe into the mountains to find ore of the very finest quality. She had also asked her dad to modify the furnace so it could hold even more phlogiston, igniting a fiercer and hotter flame that would be intense enough to melt any ore. She had specially re-engraved all of the phlogiston engraving diagrams in the workshop, ensuring that every spark that flew during the forging process was under her complete control.<!--\n              -->Alright, Xilonen, everything's ready. Strike while the phlogiston's hot, huh? So... Where should the first strike fall? What pattern should I forge? How many strikes will it take?<!--\n              -->Silence filled the workshop, and even the flames dared not crackle, lest they disturb the craftswoman at work.<!--\n              -->Placing her hammer aside, Xilonen picked up a comb fashioned from the tooth of a wild beast in its stead. This comb had been polished sleek and smooth, investing the intense fire that reflected off its surface with a mild, gentler warmth.<!--\n              -->Its previous owner was a kindly old woman. Whenever Xilonen used to slack off, she would offer to comb her hair as a way of coaxing her back to study.<!--\n              -->The old woman would also braid her hair into beautiful, intricate plaits — so complex, in fact, that even Xilonen's mother could not work out how to recreate them, and eventually had to ask for her help. After all, above all others, those were the plaits that Xilonen loved.<!--\n              -->The story of Teyiz the Name Engraver resurfaced in Xilonen's mind. That was a story she had hunted down and gathered herself; and now, she would be the one to forge it into a Name.<!--\n              -->A hammer blow shattered the silence. Each strike was precise and powerful, and no detail of the story was left untold. Even the most fleeting nuances now rose up before her, ready to be wrought by her hammer.<!--\n              -->As the final drops of phlogiston were consumed and the furnace began to fade, before her she beheld a brand-new Ancient Name.<!--\n              -->Teyiz's story had been imprinted into this Name, never to be distorted again.<!--\n              -->As for whom the Wayob would bestow it upon... Well, that was the Wayob's concern, not hers.<!--\n              -->Xilonen stood up, dusted off her clothes, and began to tidy up her workshop. She bent down to toss away a few unused pieces of ore into a basket — they were all of excellent quality, and could certainly be re-used for something else.<!--\n              -->\"Hmm, wonder what I should eat later? Didn't Mom say we'd be having fish for dinner...?\"<!--\n              -->One, two, three... the lumps of ore clinked as they landed in her basket.<!--\n              -->Absorbed entirely by her dinner plans, Xilonen didn't notice that there was something quite special about the fourth, amber-colored \"ore\" in her hand.<!--\n              -->With another soft clink, the Vision landed in her basket too, which Xilonen then carried out of the workshop and casually left outside.<!--\n              -->Humming a song, Xilonen went off to eat her dinner. It was only during her next forging session that she would finally notice this special \"ore\" of hers.<!--\n              -->It was a gift; but also, a responsibility."

Phlogiston-aided flames are much stronger than that of a regular fire...What do I do with the gems after the phlogiston is used up?

Even being a regular blacksmith is easier than working as a Name Engraver, and I could earn more to boot.But, in the end, I chose this path.Forging Ancient Names is an important task that someone must undertake, and given I happened to have the right abilities for the job, it became my duty to inherit the craft. It's just like what my father always said — \"When every person in Natlan takes up the responsibility they can shoulder, Natlan will stand strong forever.\" The job is now my duty, and I perform it regardless of my level of personal interest....And on top of that, I was the most skilled among those who studied the craft in the tribe. If I didn't become a Name Engraver, that would mean someone else would have to take it on in my stead. The other students constantly asked me questions and copied my homework. Had it become their job to forge Ancient Names, I'm sure they would constantly come bothering me with questions. So I figured that taking the job myself would be better than dealing with all that trouble... Yeah, it's more convenient for everyone, and saves me from having to worry about other people's work all day."

The Three Moons were once satellites that guarded Teyvat, and the Moon Sisters were executors of the planet's will. Celestia's principles were once quite \"tolerant,\" not necessarily requiring the exclusion of those divergent from itself.<!--\n              -->For the Three Moon Goddesses, their sole duty was to maintain the planet's existence and operation. And so the moonlight continued to illuminate the lands of Teyvat. Alas, even they, who kept to themselves, could not remain uninvolved. Inevitably, conflicts between those in power would affect some of those who were subordinate to them.<!--\n              -->If any survivors of bygone golden Hyperborea yet endured to the present day, they would surely have many tales to tell, but alas, the Frostmoon Scions do not understand their ancestors' grievances. They can now only pray to the bright moon in vain.<!--\n              -->In this, Lauma was relatively fortunate, even amongst blind believers. She did not know anything of the above, but she could nonetheless sense keenly that the full moon in the sky was bright yet lifeless. Rather, the tides that truly moved her heart and caused her antler-crown to grow were somewhere farther away, beyond her reach.<!--\n              -->This feeling had troubled her for a long time, and like how one might feel if made to pray to an apple painted on canvas, beseeching it to satisfy their hunger, she was ever restless.<!--\n              -->Fortunately, this question was now answered at last. Although the sky had suddenly \"become\" fake, she had confirmed the authenticity of her senses.<!--\n              -->She had never thought ignorance to be a good thing, even if the truth was more unsettling.

These might seem irrational to others, so for the longest time, she never mentioned them to anyone.<!--\n              -->She believed that she must never lie. Silence, too, was an answer in the face of uncertainty, but one must never fabricate facts to fashion peace papered over. This was especially so for a Moonchanter, one whose every word the believers all too easily took for truth. Thus, lying was an unforgivable sin.<!--\n              -->But was praying to a false moon in the sky a lie in itself? She could not be sure of that, and this again left her feeling restless.<!--\n              -->She resolved that she must never give herself to wrath. The Maiden of the Grove was to be gentle and loving, just as the Frost Moon's goddess was. The lake's light beneath the moon was free of ripples — had the goddess's envoy any right to be angry? The tides of kuuvahki often disturbed her peace of mind, yes, but surely a leader worth their salt must learn to control their emotions.<!--\n              -->Yet some emotions did not arise from the tidal motions. She was not given to shouting or crying out in rage, but was giving her foes a thrashing anger? She rubbed her fingers together somewhat nervously. With whom could she consult on this matter?<!--\n              -->She told herself that she must not change. Over countless years of evolution, the Frostmoon Scions had drifted far from their golden era. Any fluctuation now could snap this precariously perched branch. This was especially so when the faithful viewed her, one born \"special,\" as their hope. She had to maintain an image befitting a Moonchanter.<!--\n              -->Yet she had already revealed the truth about the moon and the sky to everyone. This time, she needed no consultation to know that change had already begun.<!--\n              -->At this point, all three precepts now seemed meaningless. Thus, Lauma finally let her guard down, and one night, she confided these unspeakable matters to her animal friends.<!--\n              -->As she expected, the little animals warmly welcomed her, and as usual, they all chattered away about life — specifically, her life.<!--\n              -->True friends they proved indeed, first affirming her honesty and reliability, then praising her gentle and caring nature, and finally declaring that Lauma had always been this way, and had indeed remained unchanged. (Hearing this made her quite happy, but she then grew increasingly embarrassed... and came to wish she had two extra legs to run away immediately.)<!--\n              -->Finally, a little cat who would often play in Nasha Town concluded: \"If I, Ashru, had to point out any problems... I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Your issue is that you're too stubborn!\""

I left a note under my pillow for... W—Well, not that I have family here anyway, so it might never have been seen, but...\"<!--\n              -->The young man also hurried to add on assurances: \"I'll take good care of her, and I'll bring her back often to visit her friends!

Secondly, I never said you could not leave. Thirdly, one must have a ceremony to go with an engagement. So please, wait here. I will get things ready.\"<!--\n              -->\"...Huh?\"<!--\n              -->Within half an hour, she had gathered everything needed for just such an engagement ritual (including somehow obtaining Nocturnal Blossoms that should only bloom at three in the morning), and in the cramped guest room (with half-packed luggage still scattered all about), conducted a complete engagement ceremony that fully adhered to the Frostmoon Scions' customs (with Lauma playing all the relevant roles — master of ceremonies, bride's family member, and ecclesiast).<!--\n              -->When all was said and done, the young woman heaved a sigh of relief. \"So you were concerned about the ritual, Lady Lauma... I must say, you're quite, ah, stubborn in the most... unexpected ways...\"<!--\n              -->\"Am I being stubborn?\" Lauma tilted her head, somewhat confused. \"This is something that must be done.\"<!--\n              -->\"Ah, yes.

You have done very well.\"<!--\n              -->\"There's no need to grieve over anyone's absence... 'Death may bring forth anger, but anger too is in vain.'\"<!--\n              -->Lauma could not help but smile, even as she held the old woman's hand in turn.<!--\n              -->So she waited, waiting for the painless and peaceful slumber to carry the elder back to the warm sea of life, where at its center, three full moons must surely be reflected."

The history of the golden realm was long indeed, and could even be traced back to the era when three moons rose in the skies.

I suppose...

In her leisure time, she and her friends would often visit the recording studios where musicians made their music, where they would dance freely to the pulsing rhythms.

But long before others had recovered from their pain, she would have wiped away her tears and stood back up again.\nOf course, she understands why the adults might see her as a good kid — yet she struggles to comprehend why she, of all people, was given the name of \"Uthabiti.\" For as the ancient poem goes:\n\"The one that dares stand firm as a mountain, their bones like battlements, and hold the sun's gaze — it is they that shall be given unto eternity.\"\n\"Fear itself should instead fear me, for my body is like a roaring blaze; destined to melt down all that is mean and lowly, then cast it once more as an epitaph.\"\nWhat part of her lives up to the lofty spirit embodied by this great name? The young Kachina has yet to figure this out. But having been granted this great honor, she is determined never to give up, no matter how many of her bids at the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame end in vain. Even if it means being ostracized and reproached by her peers, or feeling disappointed, inferior, and at times nearly overwhelmed by landslides of negativity... In the end, she'll wipe it all away along with her tears. Because one thing is for certain — that \"Uthabiti\" Kachina will never be defeated by her tears."

    "text": "Other than the required applicant information on the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame pre-registration form, there is also a page for providing optional information about the candidate. The information it asks for includes, but is not limited to, hobbies, personal experiences, and so on. The original purpose was to make it easy for the promotional team to create materials to hype up participants, but practically everyone already knew all the info on the hottest contestants, so trying to find out that way was completely unnecessary. And so, over time, nobody took the supplemental form seriously. It seems like only Kachina would carefully fill in every blank on the supplemental form every time.<!--\n              -->\"Hobbies: Dancing.\"<!--\n              -->Every member of the Children of Echoes knows a thing or two about dancing, and a stereotype the other tribes have about the Children is that dancing is in their blood. The moment music sounds, the children of the Nanatzcayan will start subconsciously swaying. But even among them, Kachina is a gifted dancer, with great control over her body even from a young age. Her movements as she shifts her weight to the beat have always been as smooth as a swimming Koholasaurus. Even Pochtli frequently praised her, and Pochtli is not someone given to giving out compliments. Actually, Kachina really wanted to write that down too, to prove she did have something to write about, but since she was worried it would look conceited, she let it go.<!--\n              -->As for her other hobby, she hesitated for a long time before finally deciding not to put it to paper.<!--\n              -->Digging.<!--\n              -->What she found embarrassing was that, like most members of the Children of Echoes, her favorite thing to do was dig around in tunnels. Whenever she discovered a vein of ore in a dark tunnel, a warm feeling would well up in her heart. Everyone in the Children of Echoes understood this warmth, but she thought writing \"digging up minerals\" in the \"hobbies\" section would only make it look like she lacked personality.<!--\n              -->\"I really don't have any strengths.\" She wanted to sigh.<!--\n              -->The next box was about the people closest to you.<!--\n              -->\"Dad, Mom, Ayo...\" She began to fill in her family's names.<!--\n              -->Other than her parents, who gave her so much love and warmth, the one closest to her was her Tepetlisaurus companion, Ayo. The one by her side the first time she tried digging alone was none other than Ayo. When her parents were recounting the legendary tales to her, and when she was out causing a ruckus, the one following close behind her was always Ayo. Just thinking of him, Kachina couldn't help but smile.<!--\n              -->She wanted to add a few other names between the lines, like Mualani, who always encouraged her with a smile, and Kinich, who always extended a helping hand when she needed it most, and from her own tribe, Uncle Pacal... But she couldn't fit that many names in the space provided, so, she had to let them go.<!--\n              -->When she finally finished filling it all in, and handed the supplementary form to the staff member on duty, they were absolutely flabbergasted that this pocket-sized little girl had actually filled out the entire form.<!--\n              -->\"That page is optional, you know. It's okay if you don't write anything down,\" they joked.<!--\n              -->Her response was: \"That's fine. Everything I can do well, I want to take seriously.\""

It is the custom of the people to work and live alongside them, and become companions.<!--\n              -->This means that for the Children of Echoes, Saurians are not like the livestock whose lives and deaths are dictated by humans, nor are they like pets, beholden to the whims of their masters. They stand as equals to humanity.<!--\n              -->Most bonds between Tepetlisaurs and humans are formed willingly, just like Kachina and Ayo.<!--\n              -->Tepetlisaurus nests are never too far from Children of Echoes dwellings, and this proximity ensures Saurian and human are often running into one another, with the latter considering the former to be friendly neighbors, never thinking it odd to meet one occasionally.<!--\n              -->For a time when Kachina was quite young, she'd often run into a robust young Tepetlisaur at the crossroads on the way to the mines. To Kachina, these simple, honest neighbors were a group worth greeting, so she'd always say \"Hi!\" to him.<!--\n              -->After a time, it seemed like the little Tepetlisaur remembered her, and she began running into him more and more different places. Practicing dancing in an open field, gathering grainfruit, catching fish in the river... After so many encounters, the young Saurian and human would not only greet one another, but also sometimes exchange gifts.<!--\n              -->Winning the little Saurian's friendship wasn't a complicated affair. Kachina didn't need to worry about trying to prove her worth to him, or offering him special rewards. They simply felt comfortable hanging out together, so they spent time together.<!--\n              -->Until one day, the little Tepetlisaur just naturally followed Kachina to her home, after which it became her family's companion, and Kachina gave him the name \"Ayo.\" The whole thing was totally normal, no less natural than how fish must swim in water or how birds must soar through the skies.<!--\n              -->From then on, Ayo always showed her the loyalty and affection he shows to friends, unlike some of the playmates she grew up with. They didn't hesitate to start keeping their distance after she failed time and time again in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, and some even mocked and ridiculed her. But Ayo has always stood firmly by her side with his sharp horn, never wavering."

At first, Kachina did not think that she was at all worthy of such an Ancient Name, brimming with honor.<!--\n              -->After consulting the ancient woven scrolls, and learning just what kind of people the ancient heroes who had borne the name before were, she felt even more perplexed.<!--\n              -->They all possessed incredible power, and would always remain bold and spirited, no matter what dangers they faced, for which they were revered by later generations; they had maintained their noble character despite enduring the harshest of conditions, protecting their homelands with naught but their own strength, never wavering in their duties or abandoning their responsibilities until their last breath. Looking back at herself, she felt she didn't have the strength of warriors of the Collective of Plenty, nor did she possess the agility of the Riders of the Flower-Feather Clan. Even though she didn't want to appear weak and easily bullied, in the face of constantly being belittled and even degraded, she couldn't help but cry and snuffle.<!--\n              -->\"Do tough people really cry all the time like I do?\"<!--\n              -->She really was a long, long way from being anything close to \"tough.\" After reaching this conclusion, she was despondent for some time, drowning in despair. But she quickly let go of those feelings. Not because she trained until she became a powerful warrior, or because she suddenly understood some profound truth. And though her friends and family did show her a lot of care and concern, her choice was mostly dictated by her own habits.<!--\n              -->No matter how badly you fall, the first thing you have to do is just get back up again.<!--\n              -->When she was even younger, every time she fell, she would already have stood up when any other child would still have been wailing on the ground. Yes, the wounds still hurt, and her tears were still splashing to the ground, but these were just innate physical reactions. She consciously felt she should stand up and look at the rock that had tripped her before carrying on crying.<!--\n              -->And the same is true now. Facing with a future without much hope, she felt intense fear, and was frustrated and lost. Being so young, she didn't yet understand how to conceal her own feelings, and so she wore her negative thoughts and emotions on her sleeve. But she would still stand up once more, sobbing and sniffling, her face painted by her tears and bruises, and keep practicing, keep pushing forward.<!--\n              -->She herself understood this as being able to take a beating, but in the words of Uncle Pacal, who was both more mature and more eloquent:<!--\n              -->\"Though people are weak, their it is through their bravery in facing this cruel world that their greatness is truly revealed.\"<!--\n              -->Maybe Kachina really is tough."

All her previous failures and defeats became little more than footnotes to her feat, buried amongst the paeans.<!--\n              -->Something felt off to Kachina.

There was no way she could suddenly become the idealized version of herself who existed only in the praise streaming forth from others.<!--\n              -->She was still the Kachina who couldn't stop herself from crying when dispirited, and she still wanted to be that Kachina who would always charge forward, getting back up again no matter how many times she falls.<!--\n              -->\"Not getting knocked down is definitely one type of tough, but maybe not losing yourself in all the flowers and praise is another.\"<!--\n              -->And so, Kachina added another footnote to her understanding of the name \"Uthabiti.\""

It only endured the long dark and loneliness, and never called itself as such.<!--\n              -->\"I'm just a chunk of totally ordinary rock.\" That's what it thought.<!--\n              -->Until a great gale had blown away the topsoil, the raging rivers had washed away the silt, an earthquake had sundered the strata, and finally, the drills of the Children of Echoes split it off from its place in the bowels of the mountain... Even then, it still hadn't realized it had a certain splendorous radiance glittering within its own rocky heart.<!--\n              -->As it was smashed and polished, the ore felt immense pain. As chisel and grindstone carried away many of its parts, and its ordinary rind was carved off, the patterns that represented its timidity were smoothed away. In the eyes of the Children of Echoes, this was a process filled with joy and beauty, but the ore knew not what was happening, or what would come next. As its tears flowed, it asked the chisel and grindstone:<!--\n              -->\"Why must this happen to me?\"<!--\n              -->To reveal your true nature as a gem.<!--\n              -->But those words remained unsaid. Unlike the ore, the chisel and grindstone had participated in the cutting of countless gems and witnessed the moment when the rays of light burst forth, and so they kept their silence.<!--\n              -->Until the work was complete at last, and the ore could finally see what it looked like in the eyes of others: a beautiful gemstone.<!--\n              -->As she walked alone through the Night Kingdom, Kachina kept thinking of this story. She remembered that she had asked her parents: What happened next? What should a gemstone look like? But the chill of the Night Kingdom blurred her memories, and she couldn't remember the rest of the fable. Fortunately, the memories of being with her parents gave her warmth, allowing the fire of her soul to burn on. She decided to stop soul-searching, for whether she was low-quality ore shattered by the chisel or a gem that yet held hope, she had to continue onward. She had many more things she wished to do, and many people she wished to see again.<!--\n              -->At the moment she was bathed in sunlight once more, and saw the outstretched hand of the Traveler, she knew what a gemstone should look like:<!--\n              -->A strong, sturdy structure, capable of holding up the world even in the darkest hour.<!--\n              -->Possessing unquenchable hope, lighting up the pitch-black world.<!--\n              -->Now, she has returned triumphant from the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame and proven herself. The day when others gaze at her with admiration has finally come, and she can bring them faith and courage. The Pyro Archon herself told her, the name Kachina will be woven into the banners by the Masters of the Night-Wind, as a part Natlan's heroic saga, flowing into the Ley Lines, becoming an eternal legend.<!--\n              -->Thus did tears and courage finally smelt the gemstone named \"Kachina.\""

    "text": "It was after her first Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. Kachina's first Pilgrimage had ended in failure, all the lofty expectations from before having come to nothing. Everyone around her doubted her ability, but more painful still was that she began to find it harder to control her doubts about herself.<!--\n              -->Maybe even the Wayob occasionally got it wrong? Could she really \"melt down all that is mean and lowly\" like in the poem? Or maybe she was actually the kind of mediocre child who should be melted?<!--\n              -->It was then that she rediscovered what digging meant to her.<!--\n              -->She had always loved drilling to the depths of the mountains, seeking out treasures, but this time, she didn't dig with any kind of particular goal. She just carried her drill and bored forward, as though as long as she just kept going, disappointment and sorrow would be unable to bore a hole into her heart, but instead became the drill in her hand, punching a hole into the heart of the mountain.<!--\n              -->She felt much happier moving forward endlessly through the darkness, where she might still turn up something good, rather than just enduring doubt and defeat. But in the world aboveground, that Pilgrimage would not be erased, and her defeat would march forward alongside time, a stamp Kachina could never rub away. Whether hiding down in the darkness, or standing upright in the sunlight, she was still completely dejected, and if she had to choose, the former was harder to bear. Because there, the word \"failure\" constantly echoed in her head, and it was far more painful for her than any of the tears and sweat she had shed in her training for the Pilgrimage.<!--\n              -->The people of Natlan have a saying, that the Children of Echoes are a stubborn lot, and their lives are like the horns on a Tepetlisaur's head, soft yet sharp, and always charging forward. And much like the saying implies, stopping was never an option in Kachina's mind. All she knew was moving onward.<!--\n              -->Perhaps the heavens had decreed she could never become a towering hero, so all she could do was trudge on forward, shifting and testing and trying to take one step, then another.<!--\n              -->Of course, what she didn't understand then is that while thrusting out your chest, holding your head high, and shouting your certainty of victory while charging forward is certainly something people aspire to, setting your jaw, gritting your teeth, and inching forward, bit by bit, one leaden step at a time, is also something truly awesome.<!--\n              -->While underground, that was precisely what she was pondering.<!--\n              -->But at the same time, she would also occasionally dig something interesting up.<!--\n              -->Like her Vision.<!--\n              -->When she received a Vision of her own, she was naturally quite happy, but she had already experienced a similar feeling of excitement before, and that was when she had received the Ancient Name \"Uthabiti.\"<!--\n              -->Neither the acknowledgment of an Archon nor of the Wayob meant that she would definitely accomplish some great deed, she had learned at least that much from reality, but what she hadn't learned was:<!--\n              -->When the legends of heroes are in their embryonic state, they aren't the least bit noteworthy, nor are the tales very encouraging, being dark and gloomy instead. But all the initial motivation they need to achieve greatness is already present, and as long as the protagonists keep on moving forward, the future will shine brightly for them.<!--\n              -->But those in the stories can never know the ending beforehand, so as they run forward with everything they have, come what may, the tears they shed are all the more beautiful."

Though Lightkeepers witness the tragic aftermath of the Wild Hunt's rampages every day, and the atmosphere in their quarters can often grow heavy and oppressive, Illuga somehow remains positive. He not only manages all tasks efficiently but also offers careful, thoughtful support to his teammates. Walking beside him, it feels as if even the lantern in your hand glows a little warmer.\nSome people wonder why someone like him hasn't chosen to work in logistics, but instead insists on going to the dangerous frontlines. Without unwavering resolve and strong inner drive, even optimistic smiles will one day be drowned by the purple-black despair. Yet whenever they hear Illuga recite the Lightkeepers' oath with conviction, such doubts vanish from their hearts &mdash; undoubtedly, beneath his gentle exterior burns a fierce, blazing fire.\nWhat are the ideals and beliefs of the Lightkeepers? This is the question newcomers ask most often, and each Lightkeeper would answer differently. Yet there is always a common thread in these answers &mdash; protection and salvation, steadfastness and unwavering resolve. They speak of a bright outcome, or a noble vision, grand and magnificent beyond measure.\nBut Illuga desires little beyond defeating the Wild Hunt, for he realizes that, in its current state, Piramida already embodies that ideal.\nOnly those who have endured the nightmare can truly grasp how precious the daylight is. What he wishes to protect is simple &mdash; the present."

This was Nod-Krai, a land where no one asks about your past.<!--\n              -->With their registration complete, the customs inspector stood and watched their silhouettes fade into the distance, a faint, inexpressible feeling stirring in his chest.<!--\n              -->For ordinary people, finding a stable livelihood in Nod-Krai had once been a luxury beyond reach. Yet fortunately for this couple, these were rare times indeed. The Wild Hunt that had long haunted the region had not launched a large-scale assault in decades. The terror it once inspired lingered only as fragmented memories, diluted by time and the passing of those who had witnessed it firsthand, until it was little more than folklore whispered in local taverns. They would settle down here, perhaps build a home, perhaps even start a family. They might yet enjoy a pastoral, almost idyllic existence, one without danger or risk.<!--\n              -->But can such peaceful times ever truly endure?<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Disaster is not in the habit of issuing warnings. When Illuga awoke, all that greeted him was a sea of flames.<!--\n              -->If it truly was fire, it should have burned red. Yet what hemmed him in were curtains of obsidian black, leaping and writhing like flames. He remembered hearing of similar flames from old tales, stories told to a backdrop of wolves howling in the night — stories that had shaped his earliest nightmares.<!--\n              -->Perhaps they had not been nightmares after all. Or perhaps nightmares are simply the truths that reality refuses to speak aloud, revealed without disguise.<!--\n              -->If he had been any other child, he would probably have wept in fear. But Illuga still remembered what his mother had said when telling him the story of the black fire. He must not cry, for if he did, the monsters — seeking signs of life — would find him. Sure enough, the wailing and screaming around him soon fell silent — the monsters must have taken them all.<!--\n              -->How long that deathly stillness lasted, he could not tell. Gradually, Illuga began to hear faint, fragmented sounds stirring within the darkness, like whispers rising up from hell itself. Yet those sounds soon faded too, and in their place, the heavy rhythm of hurried footsteps, followed by spreading light.<!--\n              -->\"Poor little thing, shaking so hard... This is no place for someone so young — nothing living, only the Wild Hunt.\"<!--\n              -->\"She really was an amazing mother... for her child... A child who can survive all this is certain to grow up strong.\"<!--\n              -->Losing his parents, along with everything they owned, felt less like a tragedy to Illuga than like waking from a dream that belonged to someone else. Had he truly survived that disaster? He could no longer recall his parents' names. Perhaps the Wild Hunt had destroyed more than the place he once called home. Perhaps, in passing, it had erased his former life as well, leaving behind an emptiness that could never be filled.<!--\n              -->And yet, given enough time, even the deepest wounds will close and heal. And fortunately, this was Nod-Krai, a land where no one asks about your past."

    "text": "Compared to the hustle and bustle of Nasha Town, Piramida, perched atop its hill, feels more like a military stronghold. Built around a towering lighthouse, the city stands like a lone warrior on the open plain, keeping solitary watch beneath the clear blue sky.<!--\n              -->Aside from the occasional merchant bringing much-needed supplies, the city is populated almost entirely by Lightkeepers. While there, Illuga's life was one of peace and tranquility.<!--\n              -->The man who had carried him from the ashes of his previous life was Nikita, a Lightkeeper who had recently inherited the role of Starshyna — though perhaps this description does not do justice to the task he faced, as his job was now little less than to rebuild the Lightkeepers from scratch, with only a handful of their number having survived the great battle just passed.<!--\n              -->Yet after enduring such catastrophe, the people of the Lempo Isles finally came to realize that the terrifying tales passed down by their ancestors were no mere myths. Many young men and women resolutely stepped forward, joining the ranks of those who would stand vigil through the long night.<!--\n              -->The newly recruited Lightkeepers affectionately referred to Nikita as \"Old Man,\" even though he was at most a middle-aged man marked by years of hardship. Thoughtful and perceptive, he had a knack for putting square pegs in square holes, giving each member a sense of purpose that made them feel at home.<!--\n              -->For an organization that demanded its members forsake a life of comfort to live eternally on the margins of danger — one that offered little in return but mere honor — this was nothing short of miraculous.<!--\n              -->For the time being, however, this had little to do with the young Illuga.<!--\n              -->During his first year or two in Piramida, Nikita himself looked after Illuga. He wasn't much good at teaching the finer points of everyday life — largely because he didn't know them himself — but he did teach Illuga a great deal about combat. Things like how to track the movements of wild beasts, and how to catch them off guard to deliver a fatal blow. Illuga learned quickly. When he focused on the fight before him, the nightmares no longer seemed able to trouble him.<!--\n              -->Before long, however, perhaps feeling that he was doing the children a disservice, and with military duties growing ever more pressing as the Lightkeepers' ranks swelled, Nikita decided to house the orphans of war who had sought refuge in Piramida in a separate residence and provide them with dedicated caregivers.<!--\n              -->Among these children, Illuga was the oldest, and he was able to move freely about the city on his own. The Lightkeepers were like an extended family — there were many \"uncles\" and \"aunts\" among them who cared for him as if he were their own. Yet Illuga kept a cautious distance from such kindness. Aside from helping to look after the other children, he spent most of his remaining time alone in the Lightkeepers' archives, losing himself in the dull stacks of records.<!--\n              -->Those records were filled with tales of heroes, yet not a single one ended in triumph. At the close of every entry, the same formulaic line appeared: \"This great Lightkeeper laid down their life to protect their home.\"<!--\n              -->\"Home?\" Illuga instinctively shied away from the very concept. While he had long since come to see this place as his home, he had never allowed himself to speak the word aloud, as though by refusing to acknowledge it, he might somehow deceive the world."

    "text": "For most of the year, life in Piramida is hard — especially for children, whose thirst for novelty and excitement the city is unable to quench. Only when a banquet is held in the great mead hall at the very top of the fortress do the Lightkeepers return from their postings to lend a hint of vitality to this otherwise grim stronghold.<!--\n              -->At such times, the older children will help out in the kitchens. For them, the focus of any banquet is the rare delicacies they get the invaluable chance to taste — and Illuga was no exception. The returning Lightkeepers brought ingredients from far-off lands, and under the guidance of the cooks, Illuga picked up quite a few cooking skills of his own.<!--\n              -->In accordance with the rules laid down by the Starshyna, the children were only allowed to take their seats once the adults' banquet had ended. Nikita's explanation was simple: \"Children aren't allowed to drink mead.\" A reason that could only fool a child, Illuga thought to himself — for he had already outgrown his childhood.<!--\n              -->Once, he slipped into the hall unnoticed, curious to see what delicacies they were keeping to themselves. What he found instead were grown-ups in tears over their cups, so lost in sorrow that none of them noticed his presence.<!--\n              -->Are banquets not supposed to be a cause for joy? Why did everyone seem so sad? Illuga kept those questions buried deep within his heart.<!--\n              -->Time ground slowly onward, day by day. For reasons he could not understand, the banquets became more and more frequent. Yet the adults showed no sign of cheer — if anything, their gloom only became harder to conceal.<!--\n              -->Even Illuga began to sense that something was wrong. His \"uncle\" in the records room, who would always hand him a slice of Lakkaberry Pie, did not return to his desk once winter ended. His \"aunt,\" who had taught him to bake bread in the kitchens, was suddenly replaced by an unfamiliar young man. He asked the adults about it once or twice, but the answers he received were vague and uncertain.<!--\n              -->During the fourth banquet of the year, the shortage of hands in the kitchen had grown so severe that Illuga was tasked with leading the children to prepare the appetizers. This time, he was finally able to enter the hall as the banquet began.<!--\n              -->The room was silent. Carrying a tray, Illuga saw the Lightkeepers standing in solemn rows, raising their cups toward the sky in a wordless offering. The sharp crack of porcelain shattering against the floor broke the stillness. In that instant, it all became clear to him, and tears spilled forth before he could stop them.<!--\n              -->The great mead hall at the very top of Piramida was a place where banquets were held to mark bitter, hard-won victories. The adults had painstakingly fashioned a papier-mache shell, hoping to shield the children from the cruelness of reality. Yet the unstaunched blood of that reality had seeped through all the same, unnoticed, saturating their fragile shield.<!--\n              -->Perhaps Illuga had understood it all along. He had witnessed far crueler scenes, replayed in every uninvited nightmare. He thought that by hiding in the dark, as he once had, he could keep the monsters at bay, until he noticed that the sand he clutched so tightly had never stopped slipping through his fingers.<!--\n              -->One day, that sand would run dry, just as the nightmares would eventually catch up with him. Before that day came, he had to do something — anything — to slow its flow, if only a little.<!--\n              -->And so he finally made up his mind, a strange sense of relief washing over him as he headed for Nikita's command post."

As the Starshyna, Nikita had drawn up a meticulously balanced nighttime patrol schedule for his order, doing his utmost to ensure everyone received sufficient rest and remained fit for duty.<!--\n              -->Nikita himself was no exception. He was not a man known for working himself to exhaustion, and so it should come as no surprise that he did not demand such of others.<!--\n              -->On the desk inside the command post, neatly processed reports were stacked to one side. Only a thin bundle of letters lay before Nikita. The broad-shouldered, middle-aged man braced his hands against the tabletop, his posture betraying no small measure of unease.<!--\n              -->Just then, a flicker of ghostly blue flame flashed past the wall.<!--\n              -->Nikita could hardly have failed to notice it, though he seemed long accustomed to such occurrences.<!--\n              -->\"Good to see you, Flins.

I'm afraid you'll have to shoulder more of the burden for a while. We've taken heavy losses this year, and we're already stretched thin...\"<!--\n              -->\"If manpower is tight, then it's only right and fair that I do my part,\" Flins answered solemnly, though he had never so much as glanced at the patrol schedule. \"Has recruitment also been down recently?\"<!--\n              -->\"After such brutal fighting, many have been frightened off,\" Nikita said with a bitter smile. \"They were all young, with bright futures ahead of them. Yet I had no choice but to send them to the battlefield.\"<!--\n              -->\"Maybe this is the burden a Starshyna must bear.\" It was unclear whether Flins meant this as consolation or merely a statement of fact. His gaze drifted to the letters on the desk. \"These are the applicants?\"<!--\n              -->\"Take a look. You know this one.\" Nikita handed him the note.<!--\n              -->\"Illuga... I remember him — the child you rescued from the ashes.\"<!--\n              -->\"I didn't save those children just to raise them into soldiers... He deserves a better future — not to die on some battlefield.\"<!--\n              -->\"But you do require his aid, do you not?\" Flins countered. \"Does he have skills?\"<!--\n              -->\"His combat skills are almost flawless. When he faces monsters, he hardly seems like a child at all.\"<!--\n              -->\"You were his teacher?\"<!--\n              -->Nikita fell silent.<!--\n              -->After a long pause, he let out a deep sigh. \"...I should've found him a good home, let him start anew, rather than keeping him here in this castle, following the same path I did. But you've met the people in Nasha Town... You can never be sure who they really are beneath the surface. How could I be sure I was leaving him with good people, and not someone whose true motives were hidden behind a harmless smile...?\"<!--\n              -->\"The dawn approaches. I should take my leave.\" Flins knew that the answer Nikita sought already lay within his heart. Rising, he returned the letter to the desk and departed from the command post.<!--\n              -->This time, he left through the door.<!--\n              -->Seeing someone emerge, Illuga, who had been waiting outside the command post, felt a twinge of confusion. When had the man entered? Could it be that Illuga had dozed off while waiting and missed him?<!--\n              -->Before he could open his mouth, the approaching Lightkeeper spoke.<!--\n              -->\"Go inside. The old man is waiting for you.\" And with that, he vanished into the night.<!--\n              -->In the eastern sky, the morning stars had already risen.

It didn't take Illuga long to realize that his new responsibilities were much the same as those he had before joining the Lightkeepers.<!--\n              -->He considered protesting — to request an assignment to the most dangerous posts, where his abilities would be truly tested. In the end, though, he remained in the logistics squad, trusting that the old man had good reason for placing him there.<!--\n              -->At least one thing was different — he could finally open his heart to the world. Perhaps because he wanted to hold on a little tighter, nearly everyone in Piramida felt the warmth of his goodwill. After all, he was a Lightkeeper now — surely it was only natural to view his colleagues as family?<!--\n              -->Logistics work involves many varied tasks — organizing supplies, collating reports, delivering messages, the list goes on. Before long, he had visited every outpost the Lightkeepers kept, both large and small. There wasn't a Lightkeeper in Nod-Krai who wasn't familiar with this enthusiastic young man.<!--\n              -->Illuga, too, took care to remember every face — the strict Sergeant Major, Marushkin, the calm and composed Olav, the ever-cheerful brothers, Ivar and Rollon... even those he had met only once were treated as family.<!--\n              -->This attentiveness, perhaps, was in no small part inherited from Nikita.

Perhaps the empty void he himself carried inside him was also beginning to shrink, slowly filled by the presence of \"family.\"<!--\n              -->Those he cared for often asked him about his favorite foods. Perhaps he didn't want others to feel burdened by returning the favor, or perhaps he simply didn't know.

Gathered around the fire, they spent a lively, joyful night together.<!--\n              -->The next day, Illuga was reassigned to the investigation squad. It felt like a natural move. His teammates trusted that this young man would lead them toward a brighter future, just as Illuga trusted them.<!--\n              -->Perhaps that had been the old man's intention all along."

As per usual, after finishing his work as a Matra, Cyno went to the library to read books relating to the Akademiya's rules and regulations. He can still well remember that the book he was reading that day mainly talked about the six cardinal sins that the sages had decided on, which they held to be the origins of all crimes and thus served as the foundation for all the modern rules and regulations of the Akademiya. While he was reading the chapter on the sin of divulging secrets without a hint of fear, he failed to fathom some chunks of the content depicted in the book, so he closed his eyes and ruminated. The moment he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a Vision, laid nicely on the page.<!--\n              -->Cyno looked at the Vision and fell into contemplation. He first confirmed that there was no existing rule that prohibited someone from being granted a Vision. Then he went over several academic cases with Visions involved and ensured that this Vision was not some malicious trap. He went on to ponder the challenges he might encounter after becoming the General Mahamatra and how this Vision might help in these future trials... After carefully weighing up the pros and cons, Cyno finally accepted this gift from the gods earnestly.<!--\n              -->By then, the morning light was already shining through the windows. Cyno left the library with the Vision and his as-yet-unfinished read in hand before heading over to the location where he was to be inaugurated as the General Mahamatra.<!--\n              -->If all went well, in half an hour, he would become the Akademiya's new General Mahamatra.<!--\n              -->He was about to be entrusted with the sacred power to judge those who had erred, and this Vision would ensure that this sacred privilege could be exercised as intended."

They know what happens to those who insist on interfering with her business, having witnessed the fallout with their own eyes. Not only do such meddlers invariably end up tasting the bitterness of defeat, but some of them — for the very first time in their lives — learn what it feels like to be thrown backside-first into the gutter... literally.\nWhat sort of background and upbringing gives a foreign fashion designer the confidence to act so boldly? This is the question that local journalists ask one another when they hear or witness such spectacles, their eyes wide with amazement. They're constantly on the hunt for anecdotes that might shed some light on her past, some even having traveled all the way to Inazuma to secretly interview her friends, family, and former tailoring mentor...\nObstinate, headstrong, and disobedient from a young age, even daring to forgo honorifics when addressing her elders... overall, not a particularly positive picture.\nChiori's parents alone would let out a smile, saying that she just has \"a unique way of thinking\" and is \"single-mindedly devoted to the pursuit of her dreams.\"\n\"Miss Chiori, may I ask... How did you manage to achieve such success? And what are the secrets to designing such wonderful clothes?\"\nSitting opposite, Chiori began to put away her needle and thread as she stared coldly back at this journalist masquerading as a customer.\n\"I make whatever I wish to, however I wish to.

The shadows of her dream were melting in her mind, leaving inky traces of sadness.<!--\n              -->\"Scissors, please.\" She pushed herself into a sitting position as her loyal assistant appeared by her side, handing Chiori the tool in her hand.<!--\n              -->\"And a pencil.\" She added, and \"Tamoto\" pulled out a pencil that seemed to have seen quite some use from who knows where.<!--\n              -->When seeking inspiration, Chiori prefers solitude to company, and often sets off on her own with little more than the clothes on her back, disliking burdening herself with this and that.<!--\n              -->A notebook is something that nags at her, as though begging her to write something down. A map is too confining, as though seeking to draw lines and boundaries through her empire of fashion without her say-so.<!--\n              -->Her drafts are harder to understand than those of any other designer in the business, for they are often drawn on menus, leaves, or even her own clothing...<!--\n              -->Yet her finished products are also more breathtaking than those of any other designer, as they are the distillation of the scenery she has seen, the characters she has met, and even those melted remnants of dreams...<!--\n              -->\"Done.\" She looked at the newspaper before her — or more precisely, the tattered remnants thereof — and nodded in satisfaction. She didn't even remember how she had picked it up today, but that was irrelevant.<!--\n              -->Her drafts are born with such spontaneity, and completed with the same free and easy spirit: They are brought back to the Chioriya Boutique, copied out onto the toile, and then turned into tea-stained taiyaki wrapping paper before finally being laid to rest in the garbage.<!--\n              -->And as for the essence of the drafts... They are for customers to admire and acclaim, and for being enshrined on the front page of fashion magazines."

Nothing left to do.<!--\n              -->Chiori lay prone before the table, eyebrows knitting at her first work. \"Tamoto\" said nothing, as though sleeping — or perhaps it was that she had simply never awoken. Chiori's habit was to use a small amount of cloth to try out her designs on Tamoto before making an outfit. Should the result prove satisfactory, she would then copy the design onto a full-size model. Yet none of her designs had been able to gain the approval of her teacher.<!--\n              -->Not long before, yet another teacher had expelled her. She had gradually come to understand that sometimes, it wasn't that her teachers disliked her designs, but that they simply didn't dare to be the first to adopt such designs. The judgmental gaze of others were threads far harder to snip than the stitches of any clothes.<!--\n              -->\"And what do you think?\" She asked the puppet in front of her. \"Tamoto\" had never complained about her designs, and would happily try on any clothes without protest. But if she could open her mouth, would she say those three words, \"I like it\"?<!--\n              -->Not long before, Ogura Textiles & Kimonos had extended an invitation to Chiori, asking her to work in the shop. Chiori appreciated Ogura Mio's intentions, for among the children studying tailoring, she was one who seemed to admire Chiori's designs.<!--\n              -->But no. Chiori shook her head, rejecting the idea.<!--\n              -->When all was said and done, that was someone's else shop, someone else's name. She didn't like the feeling of dwelling within the home of another.<!--\n              -->\"Fontaine...\" She whispered softly. The word had been bubbling to the surface of her mind of late, as a hummed tune overheard may linger forever in the ear, unforgettable.<!--\n              -->The books said that was the capital of fashion, a city of the arts. The merchants said it was a place that revered entertainment, and that anything interesting would be liked by everyone there.<!--\n              -->Then, Chiori had thought it too far away. It would take months of travel just to get there. Now, she felt that Inazuma was too far away. Her designs would reach few here.<!--\n              -->\"Fontaine... Fontaine...\" She murmured the name several more times, as though doing so could pull that faraway country closer to her.<!--\n              -->As she thought of \"Ogura Textiles & Kimonos,\" she found herself speaking another name — \"Chioriya Boutique.\"<!--\n              -->—It was as though her heartstrings had suddenly been plucked and were now humming. The sounds of \"Fontaine\" and \"Chioriya Boutique\" were two notes that seemed to form a perfect harmonious chord.<!--\n              -->\"Fontaine's 'Chioriya Boutique'...\" She closed her eyes and imagined a sign emblazoned with her name appearing on Fontaine's vibrant avenues, and how the people there would sound speaking the strange name. It suddenly all seemed so real to her, as though, at that moment, the real her was already in Fontaine, and the \"her\" left here was merely a shadow she had carelessly left behind in Inazuma.<!--\n              -->She swiftly sat up and left the house without so much as a word to her parents. They were shocked, and looked at each other in dismay, guessing that perhaps she was going out for a walk to unwind. Yet when she next returned, she had already said her goodbyes to some, and left a few others with no doubt as to what she really thought of them. Either way, the name \"Chiori\" would certainly return to Inazuma's shores long before she did. That was the oath she swore.<!--\n              -->\"I'm leaving tomorrow,\" She said to her parents. That melody humming internally was urging her forward, and she had to go chase the her that was in Fontaine.<!--\n              -->Her mother looked at her father reproachfully, as if to say \"Of all the traits she inherited, it had to have been your personality.\"<!--\n              -->Naturally, her parents didn't try to stop her, as they knew very well that once this child said something, it was already set in stone.<!--\n              -->As Chiori returned to her room to pack her things, the items on her table suddenly shifted, startling her.<!--\n              -->\"Tamoto\" slowly turned in circles, as though showing off the clothes Chiori had made for her, before happily floating over to Chiori— and in the puppet's outstretched hands was a brilliant Vision."

If you're lucky, you may also catch a glimpse of robots speeding by... Ask around, and you'll learn that these are all Aino's creations.\nIf this piques your curiosity, and you wish to meet this genius inventor, it's no tall order. Just walk out of Nasha Town and head to the outskirts, where a giant metal building awaits. Before even stepping inside, you'll be greeted by a unique aroma — a blend of machine oil, metal, and krumkakes, the smell of home for Aino, who stays here with Ineffa, her all-purpose household robot. Aino lives life by a simple creed: Invent interesting mechanical wonders for fun, and when not tinkering away, enjoy the best snack in the world — Ineffa's freshly-baked krumkakes.\nHowever, not all are lucky enough to meet this genius mechanic. Any who do not appreciate her creations will see the Craftshop's door slam shut in their face. So, before flooding her with endless new requests, maybe shower Aino's designs with some well-deserved praise first. Otherwise... Well, wouldn't it be a shame if disgusting krumkakes started popping out of your next mechanical device for whatever reason?"

She was so unassuming that it seemed almost impossible to reconcile that memory of her with the genius mechanic she is today.<!--\n              -->Katya could no longer remember if she had ever asked Aino herself about the details of how she showed up at the Speranza. In this bitter frontier, there were only two reasons why a child would be alone — unavoidable separation or deliberate abandonment. Neither was particularly rare.<!--\n              -->The rain in Nod-Krai is bone-chillingly cold, its arrival both sudden and merciless. Little Aino, who could barely reach the table's edge even on tiptoes, could only silently accept the grueling hand that fate had dealt her.<!--\n              -->Katya remembered pulling the timid girl, who had been peering through the doorway, into the house and handing her a bowl of warm, sweet soup. But as soon as the girl's fingertips touched the rim of the bowl, she quickly recoiled — her hands were swollen and purple from the cold, with cracks in her skin more striking than the scarlet broth. However brief her contact with the bowl, it must have stung her with pain.<!--\n              -->Katya wrapped her tiny, injured hands in clean old cloth, and only then did the girl dare to clutch the bowl. With a few quick slurps, she gulped down the soup, finishing her meal in the blink of an eye.<!--\n              -->From that day on, little Aino stayed at the Speranza and became a member of the Conch Gang."

On the contrary, her curiosity was so vast that only an entire world could contain it — a world made with precise, logical lines, craftsmanship, mechanisms, and curios. Any metal component was enough to make Aino stop in her tracks, and the noise of clinking and clanking from the \"Rossum Workshop\" workshop was the song she came to be most familiar with.<!--\n              -->This is how she met her lifelong best friend — Lyulka, the daughter of the owner of the \"Nuts and Bolts.\" When Lyulka discovered that this girl, who visited their shop almost daily, had the same sparkle in her eyes as herself, she excitedly took her by the hand, suddenly eager to share her mechanical contraptions and half-finished prototypes.<!--\n              -->One day, after they became close, Aino suddenly pointed at a machine in the store, and said, \"Adjusting this part a little should increase the kuuvahki consumption efficiency by 2.8%.

Although she felt slightly hesitant that an untrained child had pointed out the issue so easily, she still nodded in agreement.<!--\n              -->When the modification was complete, the test data was precise, showing an improvement of exactly 2.8%. As she stared at the truth laid out by the data, Lyulka's skepticism dissolved into amazement.<!--\n              -->\"Aino's never studied a day of mechanical theory in her life, and yet she identified and resolved a critical issue.

A Snezhnayan mechanic known as \"Papa Wrench\" happened to visit Nasha Town, and while dining at the Speranza, he was drawn to the group of child workers. Papa Wrench, being a man full of compassion, decided to stay for a while to regale the children with Snezhnayan fairy tales.<!--\n              -->But he quickly and keenly noticed that one of the children was not quite like the others — while they were immersed in his stories, Aino's gaze was firmly fixed on the tools he carried.<!--\n              -->This discovery filled Papa Wrench's heart with joy, and with Katya's approval, he set up a small class during the restaurant's downtime to teach mechanical know-how to children who were interested.<!--\n              -->When Lyulka heard of this class, she excitedly joined the children. However, after just a few days, Lyulka realized that the things Aino asked Papa Wrench were starting to become as incomprehensible as some arcane tome.<!--\n              -->Before, Aino had been like a tranquil stream, silently meandering forward... But now it seemed that she had finally found a vast, boundless ocean to call her own.<!--\n              -->Utterly in her element, a mysterious change overcame Aino, as though some fae of legend had touched her with a blessed hand, bestowing upon her secret gifts. Aino's fingers danced between various parts, an intricate machine seemingly flying into being at her expert touch. It was hard to imagine her dexterous digits had ever been blistered with frostbite.<!--\n              -->And as her hands grew more lively, so too did the conversations she made. Aino began to speak more and more, her little head seemingly filled with endless novel ideas waiting to be shared with the world. Most adults who heard her would find the child peculiar and dismiss her ideas with a gentle smile, but Papa Wrench believed that she might one day truly turn all of her imaginative concepts into reality.<!--\n              -->And when Papa Wrench's knowledge collided with Aino's wild ideas, the result was an explosion of ingenuity that brightened the lives of those around them...<!--\n              -->The Conch Gang's broken alarm clocks were fixed, but suddenly grew wings and would fly around their rooms in the mornings, ringing all the while. Only catching them would put an end to the cacophony, and from then on, there were no more sleepyheads among the children.<!--\n              -->The broken trash can in the back kitchen was also patched up with tin plates. When fed with garbage, it would chew up everything contentedly, then let loose a playful burp of satisfaction.

Reluctant to leave, he placed a screw in Aino's palm and told the girl two important things: To never underestimate her talents, nor to ever put down her tools. This wasn't Aino's first farewell. The cold wind seemed to leave her throat sandpaper-dry, and besides a cursory \"thank you,\" \"goodbye,\" and \"take care,\" Aino didn't know what else she could say. In this turbulent land, every farewell could very well be their last. This unspoken rule was understood — and keenly felt — all over Nod-Krai.<!--\n              -->After bidding farewell to her teacher, Aino sat alone behind closed doors, repeatedly running her fingertips over the grooves of the screw. After her tears had dried, she threaded the screw into her hair. From then on, this screw served both as an iron hairpin and a guiding light, keeping up the bangs that had once obscured her vision.

Lyulka had reached out to her, asking if she would like to move in with her, and perhaps even set up a workshop together. After much deliberation, Aino shook her head. While conducting stable research with a friend would be nice, she wanted to journey farther, see more, and create fascinating machines that none had ever made before.<!--\n              -->Aino had heard from some adventure-loving children that if one were to leave Nasha Town and head west, there was a place piled high with abandoned metal scrap — perfect for young explorers to use as a secret base. However, the mead-drunk, grizzled adventurers of the town saw it differently. They claimed it was a mechanical boneyard that had fallen into ruin during Nod-Krai's golden years, its name long eroded by the river of time.<!--\n              -->\"Discarded metal scrap, a mechanical boneyard... Well, time for me to breathe some new life into it...!\"<!--\n              -->Though she had never been there, Aino was filled with longing for that storied location.

Followed by an automated toolbox with wheels, and guided by members of the Conch Gang, she arrived at a massive structure on the outskirts of town. This weather-beaten mechanical beast lay sprawled along the silent ridges, waiting for its master to awaken.<!--\n              -->\"This is the place! From now on, I'm calling it the Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop. Here, I'll invent a machine that can make the most delicious krumkakes!\" With one hand on her hip, Aino made her declaration. The giant's rusty mechanical arms swayed in the breeze, as if in greeting.<!--\n              -->The smoke from Speranza drifted away, the laughter of the Conch Gang faded, and the large, long-silent workshop found itself a tiny, noisy new master.<!--\n              -->And so time slipped away amidst countless clinks and clanks.<!--\n              -->The next time Katya saw Aino, she was holding hands with a robot girl named Ineffa and had come to buy some sweets from the restaurant.

Oh, wait, I almost forgot. Aunty Katya, could you take the change and gimme some sugar for it? I'm gonna have Ineffa make me some of the BEST krumkakes in the whole world!\"<!--\n              -->But despite all the change, Aino's sweet tooth had stayed constant. Katya couldn't help but smile as she placed several packets of sugar into the robot girl's hands — far more than what would have been commensurate with the Mora.<!--\n              -->\"Calculating price difference... The amount of Mora paid is insufficient. I must compensate...\" Before the robot girl could finish, Aino interrupted her.<!--\n              -->\"That there is Aunty Katya's love! Just take it, Ineffa. She'll be sad if we try to pay for it. So thanks, Aunty Katya!\"<!--\n              -->\"Love?\"<!--\n              -->\"Yeah!

She could complete most simple mechanical constructions with her eyes closed, and it was rare to see her this focused.<!--\n              -->But today, her surroundings were pitch black, with only Aino's workbench blazing bright as day. Her long sleeves had been hastily rolled up, and her temples were covered in sweat, stained with oil, and brushed by dust from who-knows-where, but the only thing Aino could focus on — and frown at — was the problem she faced. On the workshop's floor, open bags of snacks lay scattered, but even the wafting, saccharine scents could not tempt Aino from her task.<!--\n              -->On the workbench lay a robot girl.

Exhaustion consumed the little genius like the night itself, and she fell into a deep sleep.

Sometimes she springs furiously across rooftops, chasing down a client who tried to scam her. Other times, she'll slump by the Curatorium's front steps, head bowed, motionless as Ashru plays with her undone braids...\nMany have posed the same question to Lady Nefer: In a town so full of rare gifts and inquisitive minds, why place your faith in a girl so ordinary — perhaps even a touch clumsy?\nNefer's reply never changes:\n\"At any rate, just trust my judgement.\"\nHowever, on especially awful days, even Jahoda will ask feebly, with her head hanging low:\n\"Boss Nef... There's no chance you'll fire me suddenly, right...?\"\n\"Why would I do that? If you're gone, who's going to feed Ashru and refill his water?\"\n\"Really...? That's the reason? But...\"\n\"Ah! Ashru! You little rascal, get off! That braid took me forever!\"\n\"Meow-meow, meow–!\"\nNefer leans her chin against her hand, watching the girl and the cat in their usual tangle of play and fuss.\nShe knows Jahoda will continue to grow. That one day, Jahoda will learn to navigate every rocky patch and treacherous storm, and steer her own life with a steady hand.\nAnd when that time comes, the girl who began with nothing but herself will have to face the question: Where does her path truly lead?\nTo Nefer, it's a \"question\" interesting enough to observe.\nTo Jahoda, it's an \"answer\" important enough to chase after."

    "text": "When Jahoda was first taken in by the Seahook Gang, or, in her own words, \"recruited,\" she occasionally had trouble sleeping.<!--\n              -->Sometimes it was the commotion outside. Sometimes, it was a job that hadn't gone smoothly. And sometimes... it was the curiosity she couldn't contain.<!--\n              -->Noisy crowds were easy enough to handle. The boss had told Jahoda that if she wanted everyone to quiet down, all she had to do was grab whatever was at hand — a cup, a plate, even a chair — and throw it into the crowd while yelling at everyone to be quiet.<!--\n              -->Jahoda had tried it, and it really worked. She'd leap out of bed, snatch up a stuffed toy, and hurl it out the window, then shout at the top of her lungs. And the thieves outside, staggering around, yelling and drinking, would actually fall silent. After that, Jahoda would mess with her tangled hair, hug her blanket, and flop back into bed. Meanwhile, everyone below would be trying not to laugh as they watched the unlucky one who had been hit by the toy. This time, it was his turn to wash it and sneak it back to Jahoda's bedside, or else their little lady would wake up in a sulk the next morning.<!--\n              -->A job that didn't go well could leave Jahoda feeling down for a long time. When it got too much, she would slip out of the house and quietly wake Zinaida. Half-asleep, Zinaida would listen as Jahoda mumbled that she'd lost her keys because there were just too many of them in the house, and they all looked the same. Next time, she promised herself, she'd color-code every key... that would solve the problem for sure.<!--\n              -->\"And remember that time I accidentally fell off the roof and landed right in front of the boss? He was in the middle of negotiating with a rival. So... why did I hand him the apple I was holding? Well... because the boss had been talking for so long, he must've been thirsty! And I only had one apple, so of course it had to go to him. What was I supposed to do, give it to the rival? I mean, sorry... I guess I'll bring two next time...\"<!--\n              -->Jahoda would ramble on until she finally fell asleep, resting her head on Zinaida's shoulder. Zinaida, having seen this countless times, would carry her back to the house, tuck her into bed, and set a glass of water on the nightstand, knowing that after all that talking, she'd be thirsty in the morning.<!--\n              -->Of course, the hardest to quiet was her occasional bursts of curiosity.<!--\n              -->And sometimes, to calm that curiosity... she had to take a few risks."

    "text": "As Jahoda grew a bit older, some Seahook Gang members would occasionally have restless nights.<!--\n              -->Sometimes it was from drinking too much, sometimes from injuries, and sometimes simply because they didn't feel like sleeping.<!--\n              -->But there was only one time when the entire gang stayed up all night.<!--\n              -->After a certain \"business deal,\" the gang held a feast to celebrate their victory. That black-hearted merchant had finally gotten his comeuppance, handing over all the money he'd swindled. After returning the victims' share, everyone in the gang was guaranteed a nice cut.<!--\n              -->At one point during the chaos, when someone reached for a necklace, the merchant had suddenly lunged, almost possessed, trying to snatch it back. He was too frail, though, and the gang easily subdued him.<!--\n              -->What followed was the same old cliché they'd seen a thousand times. The swindler started bawling, swearing he'd give up everything if they'd just return the pendant. According to him, it held the only picture left of his wife and daughter.<!--\n              -->These experienced thieves, of course, weren't fooled. Nine out of ten swindlers they'd tied up would use the same excuse to beg for something back, and that \"something\" usually hid a clue to some treasure, a way for them to crawl back from rock bottom. After tossing the merchant a bit of money, the gang headed straight back to their base.<!--\n              -->But just as everyone had eaten and drunk their fill, and it had come time to divvy up the spoils...<!--\n              -->\"Wait... Where's Jahoda? She was just here...\"<!--\n              -->\"Boss, that necklace is gone! C—Could it be...?\"<!--\n              -->Jahoda had disappeared. And with her went the necklace — neither too expensive nor too cheap, but enough to cause a stir.<!--\n              -->Silence swept through the hall. The seasoned thieves glanced at one another. None of them believed Jahoda would betray them over some random necklace. Besides, Jahoda probably didn't even know what the word \"betrayal\" meant.<!--\n              -->At last, Zinaida spoke up, hesitant and uncertain.<!--\n              -->\"She wouldn't... really have gone to return that necklace, would she...?\"<!--\n              -->Before she even finished, a small door at the back of the hall creaked open. Jahoda slowly poked her head out. But instead of sneaking back into the noisy, crowded room she'd imagined, she froze at the heavy silence that greeted her.<!--\n              -->\"S—Sorry... I... I was just in the bathroom...\"<!--\n              -->The first weary sigh came from the boss, his face buried in his hands. The second came from Zinaida, now certain she'd guessed right. One sigh after another followed, filling the hall, while Jahoda lingered at the doorway, still peeking in, unsure whether she should step inside.<!--\n              -->\"Jahoda, dear, come here.\"<!--\n              -->The boss beckoned to the girl, who was fresh off finishing a secret little adventure.<!--\n              -->\"We're deducting the cost of that necklace from your share, so you'll get nothing this time.\"<!--\n              -->\"B—But that necklace... Huh? Wh—What necklace? I have no idea what you're talking about! I...\"<!--\n              -->\"Jahoda.\"<!--\n              -->\"Yes, Boss!\"<!--\n              -->\"Quiet.

It could hire members of the Seahook Gang to take out their own boss, throwing the troublesome gang into disarray. It could buy barrels of oil to burn away all the evidence and scare off the faint-hearted. And most importantly, it could be used to buy valuable intelligence from that mysterious businesswoman.<!--\n              -->The hidden powers that once controlled Nasha Town were gone, leaving only money as the path to power.<!--\n              -->But the hunter who had set his sights on him didn't need it.<!--\n              -->\"Enough! Show yourself! What do you want from me!?\"<!--\n              -->The burly man bellowed into the silent forest. His camp had just been raided again. Somehow, the small, wiry assassin had slipped inside, effortlessly taking down one guard after another. She had pierced three warning drums with her arrows and even reached the very center of the camp. If she hadn't stumbled from the roof in her weakened state, Ratfan's head would already have been separated from his body. Yet even after taking two arrows and a hammer blow, she had still dashed back into the forest, disappearing without a trace. And just like countless nights before, she would return the next night, always managing to track Ratfan no matter where he fled.<!--\n              -->Exhaustion and fear had everyone on edge. Some said the girl had long since died, and that what kept returning was merely her spirit, driven by obsession. Others said she had devolved into a member of the Wild Hunt, and that only the Ratniki could stop her now.<!--\n              -->But Ratfan knew the truth: she was just a little girl. He had seen Jahoda when he scouted the Seahook Gang before, and even the gang's boss had praised her highly.<!--\n              -->Back then, Jahoda was a slight and ingenuous kid. When she stood below with the others, she would secretly tug at her companion's hand, swaying back and forth, only calming down after a gentle tap on the head. She had looked nothing like a thief. By any measure, she still had a long way to grow, or perhaps, she didn't even know what form she wanted to shape herself into.<!--\n              -->Now Ratfan knew he had been wrong. Jahoda didn't need time to grow — she just needed a reason.<!--\n              -->And he had given her that reason with his own hands.<!--\n              -->—So be it, then. They would settle this in the way thieves knew best.<!--\n              -->Another night, Ratfan had torches planted all around the camp, and he stood alone in the center, weapon in hand.<!--\n              -->He couldn't even remember the last time he had held a weapon himself. The sword felt impossibly heavy, heavier than a bag stuffed full of Mora.<!--\n              -->As expected, his opponent appeared, calmly stepping into the obvious trap.<!--\n              -->The torches lit up Jahoda's face, gaunt from hunger. A lingering fever had drained all color from her skin, and her hair clung to her cheeks like withered grass. Her lips were cracked like parched earth, yet her eyes still shone, bright, sharp, and unyielding. It was as if she had struck a bargain with death itself, her soul burning with a fierce vitality that would last until her vengeance was complete.<!--\n              -->Jahoda was a lone gambler, and her life was her final chip.<!--\n              -->Since she had nothing to lose, why not go all in?<!--\n              -->\"Kid... let's talk, alright? Whatever you want, I can give it to you, just name it.\"<!--\n              -->Ratfan swallowed hard, the bravery he'd scraped together already slipping away.<!--\n              -->He knew those eyes too well. They belonged to a desperate soul.<!--\n              -->\"I—I know you're a good person, Jahoda...\"<!--\n              -->Jahoda had nothing. But he had so much — money, jewels, gold, wealth, luxury, all waiting for him.<!--\n              -->\"L—Listen to me, don't do anything reckless... we can...\"<!--\n              -->But Jahoda didn't need any of it.<!--\n              -->She had already sunk her teeth into her prey."

    "text": "To Columbina, this planet was never a kind mother. It gave her a singular, extraordinary identity when it birthed her — but that seemed to exhaust all the love it could offer. In the days that followed, her mother rejected her outstretched arms with cold silence. Columbina could only close her eyes and grope forward between one wall and another. The maze that trapped her was a circle, a spiraling tower reaching upward. Columbina softly hummed the melodies in her memory, her only connection to her \"mother.\" Barefoot, she walked through the Frostmoon Enclave and Glupov, eventually returning to the Silvermoon Hall, where her own echoes still lingered on the walls. But unlike before, she had finally found a name of her own with the help of her friends. She now had hope, as well as desires. She wanted to go home. Now, at the top of the tower, the moon that held her answers hovered just within reach. She stretched out her arms, but it was like the moon falling into water. Of Silver Skies, Cleansed Feathers, and the Returning New Moon. She walked toward death, and death answered her with rebirth. She reached the end, only to find it waiting as her beginning. The world waited in the hush that preceded creation. Within that silence, a force stirred — gravity was cast toward her, strong enough to draw a wandering moon back into its swaddling cloths. Before her, the moon's path revealed itself, a road laid out to guide the Moon Goddess home. She is no longer the moon seen through water, a distant image, endlessly shattered and restored. Instead, she will sing fate into the darkness, set the tides in motion, and bring freedom and hope to those who dwell beneath the moon. Columbina opens her eyes, as though only now she is truly born into the world."

She knew these words to be like mirrors, each reflecting a version of her in this unfamiliar world. But those were versions others wished to see. She did not recognize herself in those reflections, just as she did not recognize the moon hanging in the sky. At least at night, she could clearly feel the pull coming from beyond the heavens. It made no sound, yet she understood it all the same — the Frost Moon was calling her home.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Spring, summer, autumn, or winter?<!--\n              -->Winter, without question. After the restlessness of spring, the clamor of summer, and the bounty of autumn, winter's snow quietly laid a finger across the world's lips, as if to say, \"Hush. After all that bustle, isn't it time for some quiet?\"<!--\n              -->And so the world would obediently fall silent. Little animals would retreat to their homes as well. Only in winter would people truly realize how important a warm \"home\" could be.<!--\n              -->As for Columbina? She loved to find a thick, soft pile of snow, before holding her breath and diving straight in. For a goddess who wasn't particularly sensitive to cold, being wrapped head to toe in gentle white snow felt simply wonderful. As to whether her colleagues understood this behavior... Well, she concerned herself little with that.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Sunny? Rainy? Or perhaps, cloudy?<!--\n              -->A rainy morning. When Columbina woke to the soft patter of rain beyond the Silvermoon Hall, a sense of calm would settle over her — the feeling of being sheltered beneath its vaulted roof.<!--\n              -->\"Shelter.\" In the rhythm of the rain, the word resonated with renewed strength, echoing the most essential meaning that \"home\" could hold. Simply existing along the extension of that meaning was enough to fill Columbina with warmth.<!--\n              -->Still... nightfall was better when under clear skies.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Were her answers to these questions truly accurate?

You did very well.\"<!--\n              -->Columbina liked praise.

It reminded her of the days before she had joined the Fatui...<!--\n              -->She felt a pang of sadness. Did anyone else ever feel sad just for being themselves? She didn't know if others felt that, but she did.<!--\n              -->It wasn't that she wanted to become what others expected, but that what they saw wasn't her.

Columbina couldn't see it, but somehow remembered — this was part of a process that had to happen after eating. Different from how procedures were back with the Frostmoon Scions.<!--\n              -->The problem was, she still wasn't used to it. She knew it involved some ritual of \"trade,\" but the few times she had done it, it was always with her two recently acquainted colleagues, Arlecchino and Sandrone. Or rather, they did it for her.<!--\n              -->Columbina didn't know what to do.

You don't even know how to apply for reimbursement, and you dare come out to eat by yourself? Ugh. You know what, I bet you don't even know how to pay either.\" The tone was impatient, but somehow reassuring.<!--\n              -->\"The Fatui's financial rules sure are rigid... and complicated,\" she muttered, quickly filling out the slip and handing it to the trembling employee.<!--\n              -->\"From now on, put her bill on my tab. It's all the same when it comes to reimbursement anyway,\" Sandrone said irritably to the employee.<!--\n              -->\"Sorry...\" Columbina murmured to her colleague, with whom she had not been acquainted long.

You don't blame me?\" Columbina asked.<!--\n              -->\"Huh? Why? Isn't this just who you are?\" came the exasperated reply. \"Seriously, though, I don't get how someone like you even survives in this world...\"<!--\n              -->No \"You should be like this,\" no \"You could do better\"... only \"This is who you are.\"<!--\n              -->Though Sandrone's tone was always impatient, there was a recognition in it — a silent acknowledgment that this was \"who she really was.\" Columbina felt joy at being seen in this way.<!--\n              -->\"...What are you smirking at?\" Sandrone asked.<!--\n              -->Columbina shook her head.<!--\n              -->\"Nothing. Let's go eat together next time, Sandrone,\" she said. \"I like seeing you handle the 'reimbursements' for me.\"<!--\n              -->\"...What?\" It seemed her dear colleague would need some time to get used to how \"she really was\" all the same."

    "text": "On nights when the moon was full, Columbina liked to quietly leave the Silvermoon Hall and wander near the homes of the little animals. Sometimes it would be a tree hollow, at others a bird's nest. She would stand nearby, listening to the steady rhythm of their breaths while lifting her eyes to the moon above. It was as if, by doing so, she could imagine what nighttime on the moon might be like — quiet and peaceful. She hoped it was.<!--\n              -->On nights like these, she pieced together dreams of what a \"home\" might be.<!--\n              -->When she once again returned to Hiisi Island, she met a certain contemporary Moonchanter. Columbina had spent much time with the Frostmoon Scions, yet she had never once seen such beautiful, enormous antlers.<!--\n              -->\"...Forgive my interruption,\" Canon, the goddess of the Frost Moon, interrupted. \"I thought there were quite a few with antlers among the Frostmoon Scions.\"<!--\n              -->Columbina explained that while it had been historically common, few were born with antlers today, and none boasted antlers as splendid as that Moonchanter's.<!--\n              -->\"The bloodline inevitably grew diluted, I see...\" The Frost Moon goddess sighed. \"Sorry... Please continue, Columbina Hyposelenia.\"<!--\n              -->After meeting that Moonchanter, Columbina occasionally made surreptitious visits to her home as well. She discovered, however, that the moon's tides seemed to bring some restless pain to said Moonchanter. In those moments, Columbina would try to use her own power to soothe the tides surrounding the woman. Sometimes, she would find herself humming familiar melodies, instinctively — the lullaby that had once comforted her before her birth.<!--\n              -->\"A lullaby from before your birth?\" This time it was Aria, goddess of the Eternal Moon, who spoke up.<!--\n              -->Columbina explained the melodies she had heard before being born.<!--\n              -->The three goddesses shook their heads. They had no knowledge of this song.<!--\n              -->Columbina continued to tell them stories of the future world: From the flavors of offerings in that world, to the music in its opera houses... From a friend with a clockwork mechanism in her back, to a former angel who became her friend...<!--\n              -->Finally, she spoke of the Moon-Prayer Night.<!--\n              -->The three moon goddesses were deeply moved by the beauty of that evening — perhaps also because Columbina herself could not help but smile as she recounted it.<!--\n              -->\"In our time, the gods of the heavens rarely had such profound connections with the world below,\" the goddess of the Frost Moon said.<!--\n              -->\"Yes. Everyone was nice to me. We even played water-ball games together.\"<!--\n              -->\"Unimaginable. It seems our era was far too conservative,\" the goddess of the Eternal Moon said, clearly astonished.<!--\n              -->\"We even stuck little stickers on each other's faces.\"<!--\n              -->A few soft gasps of surprise came from the three goddesses.<!--\n              -->\"We also exchanged food, tasting the candy in each other's hands.\"<!--\n              -->The goddesses fell silent. Columbina felt glances tinted with envy pass between them.<!--\n              -->Long moments passed.

After all, her eye mask had fine gaps in it.<!--\n              -->The stars may lie, but the tides of gravity do not.

Long, long ago, their forerunners once measured the world with their feet, transforming the winding, perilous paths they walked into networks of orderly lines on their maps.\nAs a member of the People of the Springs' new generation of young guides, Mualani has already established an eminent name for herself throughout Natlan. With her to lead the way, you'd be sure to experience the spectacular sight of volcanic eruptions, breathe in the refreshing natural fragrance of Embercore Flowers, even witness spontaneous performances put on by packs of Koholasaurs. But likewise, if there was an emergency or you just needed to be somewhere urgently, she'd find a shortcut to get you there as safely, soundly, and smoothly as possible.\n\"Everyone knows the routes,\" Mualani herself would tell you. \"But timing's the key. You can't just set off whenever you feel like it &mdash; that would be extremely unlucky!\""

Not only have they established a trade network that spanned Natlan, but they have even established partnerships with foreign merchants.<!--\n              -->When she was little, her parents were always busy cultivating relationships with their business contacts, and sometimes, they'd be running around outside the home for weeks at a time. So, Mualani would often roam around town with their puppy, or spend her time with the other kids in the tribe, trying their hand at all kinds of watersports.<!--\n              -->It was only on holidays that the family would always decorate their house and make a big meal to celebrate.<!--\n              -->During one such family dinner, Mualani asked if she could help lighten their load and shoulder a bit of their work.

Many of those faraway vistas were truly enchanting, but as a seabird whose home was by the coast, she often missed the salty smell of the seabreeze.<!--\n              -->And so she returned home and engaged in all kinds of watersports, researching the equipment used in them. She wasn't satisfied with the completed products available, so she began learning how to manually modify their functionality herself. She would also apply some lucky colors and some patterns, giving the products a dash more personality.<!--\n              -->She became the trendsetter, and every time she changed her gear, everyone else would fall all over themselves to get identical items.

Naturally, some among them are more into the sports aspect, and others are more focused on the equipment.<!--\n              -->Regardless, Mualani gradually experienced the joy of operating a business — the smiles on the faces of people when they receive something they love shine brighter than glittering gold.<!--\n              -->What is this really what Mualani wants to do the most? If you ask her that question, she'll definitely scratch her head:<!--\n              -->\"Hey, life's a journey, you know, and you can keep on enjoying all kinds of scenery as long as it lasts!

Whenever she arrived someplace, she'd wander around, chatting with locals and asking about fun things to do nearby, good places to eat, or any unique local customs, and then decide on the spot what to do that day.<!--\n              -->If she really hit it off with someone, she'd happily invite them along.

Next is knowing the land itself, such as how to judge the direction of the tides and the length of time between eruptions. You must also have actually traveled across the landscape, traversing the canyons, caves, and volcanoes. Yes, spend about three years doing that, and you'll be ready to start learning.\"<!--\n              -->Mualani was about to just turn and leave, but suddenly thought better of it. She did want to see many places she ordinarily wouldn't, and so she paid a huge sum as her tuition fee.<!--\n              -->Though Nuu emphasized that reaching your destination safely was the most important thing, Mualani could never resist seeing where the other fork in the road led. After all, what if there was some amazing treasure waiting to be found? And so, all kinds of accidents inevitably happened, like accidentally charging into Koholasaurus nests or falling into pits concealed by grasses.<!--\n              -->But Mualani didn't fuss about such situations. To her, taking the wrong road helped her remember the right path, not to mention that sometimes, her misadventures led to windfalls — for example, finding an ore unknown to anyone in their time buried at the bottom of the pit.<!--\n              -->Later, when she officially became a guide, she remembered her teacher's words, and planned the safest, most reliable routes for travelers. Still, a journey without happy accidents was kind of like an Apple Roly Poly without Apple, and that was completely unacceptable to Mualani.<!--\n              -->Once, she was taking some tourists to a plateau that commanded an expansive view. She suggested a group photo, and just as they had all gotten into their poses and chosen their expressions, just as Mualani was lifting up the Kamera, a volcano in the distance suddenly erupted.<!--\n              -->Mualani pressed the shutter in that very instant, and clapped and laughed at the resulting photo. \"A perfect shot! Go me! Guess I planned out the best spot for the picture, huh?\"<!--\n              -->Just then, a massive rumbling caused the tourists to look at each other apprehensively. Mualani reassured them:<!--\n              -->\"Relax, it's totally safe at this distance! Next up, there'll be a few smaller eruptions. You'll never see anything else like it, so have a seat and enjoy the show!\"<!--\n              -->That's the kind of reliable guide Mualani is, helping you reach your destination safely even amidst heart-stopping excitement.<!--\n              -->Shame, though, that even to this day, she's never found a Saurian relic that can fetch a decent price."

Apparently, the active volcano had already altered the terrain in the area.<!--\n              -->Following Citlali's advice, she was able to lead the entire group to the original destination without incident, as expected.<!--\n              -->From then on, Mualani respectfully referred to Citlali as the \"coolest elder,\" and often brought her all kinds of presents as she sought \"life advice.\" It was from that time that the frequency of Mualani's mentions of \"good luck\" and \"bad luck\" began to steadily tick upwards.<!--\n              -->Even to this day, the two wage war from opposite sides of Citlali's door.

But the life she actually saw was nothing like that chronicled in the woven scrolls, filled with danger and excitement.<!--\n              -->The People of the Springs that Mualani remembered had a really laid-back atmosphere, and they lived leisurely lives, never too hurried. When the big kahunas agreed to discuss some important matter or another, they'd usually take a nice comfy soak in the hot springs first, then enjoy some snacks along with milk before finally slowly getting around to the actual business.<!--\n              -->Even the music popular amongst the tribe tended to be really laid-back and mellow.<!--\n              -->Hearing those stories of distant battlefields as a child, the puzzled Mualani once posed this question to an elder tasked to serve as a guardian:<!--\n              -->\"Is the Abyss a dangerous enemy?

Her long experience with watersports ensured that she had phenomenal physical capabilities, and she was like a charging shark in battle.<!--\n              -->Later, she organized a team to participate in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, but as the squad was mostly composed of newcomers, they quickly wiped out in the team round.<!--\n              -->Her teammates were pretty dejected, but Mualani was as cheerful as ever: \"We managed to go a few rounds with the pros!

She sped up, putting some distance between them: \"In that case, let's race!\"<!--\n              -->Accepting her challenge, the freshwater shark pursued her relentlessly as Mualani sped on ahead with everything she had, the spray laying a long white raceway for them.<!--\n              -->As they approached the coastline, the freshwater shark turned back in a fury, its hunt a failure. Mualani, not far away, waved back at it: \"Let's play again next time!\"<!--\n              -->Later, she would encounter this same challenger in those same waters. Mualani dubbed it \"Sharky,\" and the two of them raced over and over. In the first few rounds, Mualani was faster, but the shark was not to be outdone, and slowly closed the gap, until finally, it caught her. But that time, it didn't chomp her, but instead elegantly shook its chubby body, announcing itself the victor.<!--\n              -->\"You won this one! Okay, here's your promised reward.\" Mualani fed it the dried fish she'd brought, and rubbed its fins.<!--\n              -->They became true surfing buddies. Until one day, after they finished playing, Sharky circled her a few times, and then waved its caudal fin, swimming off in the direction of the setting sun.<!--\n              -->Mualani waved as she usually did, but when she next went to her old spot to surf, she didn't see that speedy round shape as she normally did.<!--\n              -->Mualani knew that any encounter is but a part of the journey, and that everyone eventually finds their new destination. Still, that doesn't mean the happiness that was shared must disappear.<!--\n              -->So thinking, Mualani took out a piece of paper, and began to draw. Two weeks later, she handed the design for the \"Sharky Surfboard\" to an artisan she was familiar with. Sharky's fins were hard, but its tail was flexible. To achieve this, she chose her materials carefully, also recreating the texture of Sharky's skin, and even reproducing how its teeth meshed together.<!--\n              -->As for the color scheme, it naturally had to be eye-catching so that everyone who saw Sharky would remember what it looked like!<!--\n              -->And so, with her new gear in tow, Mualani was the center of attention once more. Amidst the ardent cries, the \"Sharky Surfboard\" was eventually mass-produced and sold to the public — though naturally, that version can't bite.<!--\n              -->When Mualani surfs, she occasionally wonders when the next time she'll get to race Sharky is.

Some had already done emergency first-aid, wrapping the wounds in bandages. By comparison, having been protected by everyone else, she only had a few shallow scrapes.<!--\n              -->A new feeling welled up in her heart, regret mixed with a feeling of defiance, a resolve not to merely accept this result. \"If only I were faster, then I'd have been of more help.\"<!--\n              -->She clenched her fists, and privately made up her mind. She would seek out the warriors of the tribe to learn how to fight.<!--\n              -->It was only after Atea brought Mualani back home that her anxious parents, who had been worrying all night, learned she had returned from the battlefield.<!--\n              -->\"She really is a very brave kid.\" Before she left, Atea patted her cheek.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->That day, Mualani dreamed for a very long time. Had her face not lain on something very hard when she rolled over, she might've slept yet longer.<!--\n              -->Opening her eyes, she felt that hard object in her hand — a crystal-clear Vision.<!--\n              -->Following the rays of sunlight streaming in through the window, she caressed it in her palm, inspecting it carefully over and over to make sure it wasn't some toy her parents had bought for her.<!--\n              -->\"Is this the spoils for winning my first fight? Now that's what I'd call lucky!\""

A—Achoo!\" Aino would insist, even while violently sneezing.<!--\n              -->\"I recommend you drink some medicine.\" Ineffa passed her a cup, somewhat helplessly. \"Don't worry, I've already added some sugar.\"<!--\n              -->Aino took the warm cup with both hands, her cheeks flushed in the heat rising from the liquid within. \"...If only you were as warm as this cup...\"<!--\n              -->That evening, after Ineffa had finally managed to soothe Aino to sleep, she retired outside the workshop, staring at her hands.<!--\n              -->The cold moonlight reflected off her metal shell, beneath which countless cogs, gears, and drive rods were spinning in concert.<!--\n              -->There were plenty of ways for this machinery to generate heat — the question was more one of maintaining a suitable temperature when not at full operational capacity.<!--\n              -->It was also important to limit acoustic energy production, which would otherwise disturb Aino's sleep. What was needed was something more subtle — something with a fine level of control...<!--\n              -->Ineffa cycled through iteration after iteration of calculations and experimentation, using herself as a test subject.<!--\n              -->After a few days under Ineffa's gentle care, Aino was almost free of her cold. Then one morning, Ineffa didn't come to wake her up.<!--\n              -->It suddenly occurred to Aino that Ineffa had been acting a little odd the last few days, and she couldn't help but worry — what if robots could catch colds too?<!--\n              -->The thought left Aino feeling uneasy, so she rolled out of bed and hurried from her workshop. But before she could call Ineffa's name, she saw her lying rigid on the ground.<!--\n              -->\"Ineffa... What's wrong!?\" Aino knelt down to gently stroke the robot's forehead, but immediately recoiled in shock. \"So hot! D—Do you have a fever?\"<!--\n              -->\"...Internal components overloaded... Attempting recovery...\" Ineffa, now unable to move, was forced to admit defeat. \"Computational error... Ideal temperature attained, but... I lack sufficient hardware to maintain this state... Requesting additional temperature control module.\"<!--\n              -->\"Of course! I'll get started tomor— no, I'll start right now! You want a cooling function upgrade, right?\" Aino didn't stop to ask why Ineffa needed to attain an \"ideal temperature,\" instead hurrying back into her workshop to work.<!--\n              -->\"No... I need something I can fine-tune, something that can maintain my current surface temperature.\" Ineffa said, staring at the sky, her body still rigid on the ground.<!--\n              -->The morning sunlight gleamed off her silvery shell, radiating the exact temperature that she had calculated as the perfect level of heat for a warm embrace."

I've eaten so much of her food by now, I guess it's time to quit while I'm ahead... I'll give her a few words of praise and tell her she's learned enough...\"<!--\n              -->\"I have given thought to what a 'soul' actually means.\" Ineffa suddenly blurted out, innocently. \"This word is often used to describe the vitality of living creatures. That's why I added some vitality-containing ingredients to my cake.\"<!--\n              -->\"Yes... soul... vitality of living creatures...

She felt a sudden sense of unease, but it was already too late — she could feel a strange wriggling sensation between her back teeth.<!--\n              -->She lowered her head to inspect the cake in front of her.

When Aino first designed Birgitta, she was only given basic functions, such as carrying wrenches and transporting components.

Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary. Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant that the mountainous piles of paperwork from the various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even a thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question. \"What I've done... is nothing compared to what Rex Lapis has accomplished.\""

Under pressure, her nervousness does result in the occasional error.One such incident occurred during the Rite of Descension, without doubt the most important annual event in Liyue's calendar.Ganyu was three minutes late for the Rite and had to squeeze through the crowd in full view of all.Later on, with a face as red as a tomato, she stammered her way through an unconvincing explanation, all the while apologizing profusely to Rex Lapis in her heart.Her colleagues guessed that there must be some reason for the mistake.Those who did not know her well saw that Rex Lapis did not mind, and thus paid the incident no attention.Those closer to her worried in private, and asked if she needed a workload adjustment or a short vacation, but Ganyu refused.\"I spent two hours making sure that I wasn't wearing anything too similar to last year's Rite...\"Needless to say, Ganyu was not about to admit to this being the real reason for her tardiness!"

When lunch hour arrives, no matter where she is, she will simply curl up into a ball and fall asleep on the spot. Even the raucous dancing of hilichurls will fail to wake her.These habits were at first just a running joke within the Liyue Qixing.But once, after accompanying the then-Tianxuan to lunch outside the city, a well-fed Ganyu simply crawled into the nearest roadside haystack. She ended up being transported all the way to Dihua Marsh, awakening only after bumping her head during the unloading.Unable to find Ganyu anywhere over the subsequent three hours, and knowing that she would not depart unannounced, the Tianxuan almost filed a missing person report.After receiving a stern admonishment to \"only take afternoon naps where it's safe,\" Ganyu retorted:\"Well... isn't everywhere in Liyue safe?\"Perhaps, with the mixture of human and illuminated beast blood flowing through her veins, Ganyu's understanding of the world's affairs is a little different to that of most humans."

For Ganyu, the difficulty of such a challenge is second only to finding a Flaming Flower atop Dragonspine.But she is not one to give up half-way through the ascent.During the Archon War, she once choked a giant monster to death with ease after getting lodged in its throat when it tried to eat her, said monster having fatally underestimated quite how wide her waistline was.For Ganyu, avoiding any similarly embarrassing episodes in the future is an absolute must."

Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a better polity there. The first Liyue Qixing would need support, and she took this task up as a matter of course, becoming their secretary. The moment she made that decision, a Vision appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans.

With a bit of luck, you might just be fortunate enough to  witness a performance of Gaming's remarkable Wushou Dance.\nWhen he puts on his mask, he shakes his head and blinks like a waking  beast. The vast array of emotions he conjures up, the unpredictable twists and turns... Following his every move with rapture, the audience can't help but cheer and applaud.\n\"Thank you for your support, everyone! And remember, if someone you know's thinking of booking a Wushou Dance, don't forget to recommend the 'Mighty Mythical Beasts'!\"\nIt's just a shame that, more often than not, he receives nothing but applause in return. But Gaming doesn't let this get to him — he laughs it off, saying that the audience's attention is all the recognition he needs.\nOnce the crowd has dispersed and his mask is off, Gaming swiftly returns to being a \"guard\" and thinking of work matters once more: How many cargo shipments still need delivering? Which clients does he need to escort? And so on...\nUsually, when there's nothing urgent on, he heads to Xinyue Kiosk to while away the time with some dim sum — a pot of tea, a selection of bite-sized nibbles, and leisurely chatter in the company of good friends.\nAs a guard, the task of escorting goods from Yilong Wharf to Liyue Harbor couldn't be easier for Gaming. But as the head of the \"Mighty Mythical Beasts,\" his dream of making the Wushou Dance a regular occurrence in Liyue Harbor still has a long, long road ahead of it...\nSo in the meantime, why not sit and enjoy another cup of tea?"

    "text": "Gaming was born in Qiaoying Village, a place famous for its tea, and his ancestors had been tea farmers for several generations, only switching to mainly selling tea leaves during his father Yip Tak's time. With his parents working together, their business was getting better by the day, and of course, any father would hope for his son to succeed him in the family business.<!--\n              -->Thanks to his father's hard work, at least Gaming no longer had to experience the backbreaking daily grind of farm work, nor would he have to start a business from scratch. But as they say, \"like father, like son\" — Gaming turned out to have his own ideas about which road to tread, just as his father had chosen to diverge from Gaming's grandfather's decision to keep growing tea.<!--\n              -->The two were at an impasse, with neither accepting the other's view. Only Gaming's eventual departure from their home put a stop to the arguments between father and son.<!--\n              -->For his next haunt, Gaming chose the bustling Yilong Wharf, having planned out how he'd make his living a while back — through a passion of his that had burned since childhood, Wushou Dance, of course.<!--\n              -->Filled with enthusiasm and confidence that created complacency, the young man blazed through creating all the relevant props, even printing flyers introducing himself and booking performance venues... He planned to plant his feet first in Yilong Wharf, then conquer Liyue Harbor, and finally, to introduce Wushou Dance to Teyvat at large...<!--\n              -->Suffice it to say that the diligent youth's passionate pursuit of his dream sent all of the business startup funds he had saved up before leaving home up in smoke, leaving him quite broke in short order.<!--\n              -->\"Making Wushou Dance your career? As if! Forget making a living, hah, you'd be lucky not to starve!\"<!--\n              -->Hungry as he was, Gaming now understood his father's words.<!--\n              -->With the mindset \"What's done is done, let's focus on getting a meal first,\" Gaming had little choice but to find a job that could put food on his table.<!--\n              -->Fortunately, fate has a habit of giving right after taking. Lantern Rite was just around the corner at the time, and the good-hearted young man led a Fontainian merchant to the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency just as a lead guard was fretting over a manpower shortage. Gaming took the opportunity to recommend himself and was promptly taken on as a temp employee.<!--\n              -->Thanks to his daily Wushou Dance training, he had a strong foundation in martial arts and tenacity in the face of hardship, and was promptly asked to stay on as an official guard for hire after finishing that escort run.<!--\n              -->All in all, that definitely counted as feeding himself through Wushou Dance... right?

Well, warm's just the way we like it, and your wall's a good fit, isn't it?\"<!--\n              -->And whenever the other party gets confused, Gaming will try supplementing his explanation through different methods, complete with various gesticulations to demonstrate his point.<!--\n              -->This manner of speaking, he explains, he got from his mother, who married into Qiaoying Village from afar, and to whom he was quite attached after his birth. He would follow her just about everywhere, and in his doings and interactions with others, he would pick up many of her habits and interests.<!--\n              -->Nothing to do? Get some dim sum. Feeling hot and woozy? Brew up some cooling tea. Eating a meal? Got to have some greens... and no, melons and fruits are not greens.<!--\n              -->These habits are not ironclad, of course. If a friend came up with some new suggestion, he would be game to try it out. People from all lands were brethren, after all, and it is Gaming's way to treat all with sincerity.<!--\n              -->He can easily shoot the breeze with just about anyone in Yilong Wharf, young or old. At first, most think his polite speech to just be pretty pleasantries, but after some time, they will find that he is being perfectly earnest. He will introduce the itinerant handyman Duqin to work opportunities, assist the ever-busy Zhigui, fetch medicinal wines from Liyue Harbor for his fellow guards, and even get Dip Yeuk to give a Suanni-themed toy to a child whom he himself has never met, all because Dip once mentioned that the boy liked watching Wushou Dance...<!--\n              -->Priceless is the friend who knows your heart, and so everyone returns the favor to this big-hearted lad. They always invite him to come in and rest his feet when he comes by with a delivery, and there is always a seat for him at a dim sum table — well, on the condition that he doesn't say \"I'll foot the bill.\"<!--\n              -->Gaming often claims that he'd never have gotten far in Yilong Wharf without everyone's help, but those familiar with the humble, earnest lad know that he would have been fine no matter where he was."

As such, no matter how busy work gets at the transport agency, Gaming will take time to train.<!--\n              -->At meals, Gaming may be found tussling cheekily with his colleagues over dishes, wielding his chopsticks like a seasoned duelist, while under the table his knees are bent in a low horse stance, sturdy as a mountain. After the cargo is packed, he will rarely get a cart to move it to a warehouse but instead will lift it all himself, box by box, to train his arm strength.<!--\n              -->The lead guard knew that their work was hard and laborious, and so from time to time would call for suggestions on items that might be added to the office for relaxation purposes.<!--\n              -->Soft beds, comfortable pillows, Genius Invokation TCG decks...<!--\n              -->At that moment, Gaming cleared his throat and said: \"If possible, could we have some Plum Blossom Poles installed in the front yard so we can train better?

How about this, then? How about I treat you all to some dim sum? Will that make amends?\"<!--\n              -->This sort of horsing about happened every so often among the guards, of course. Everyone knew that Gaming wanted the Plum Blossom Pillars for Wushou Dance practice, and everyone was just playing along with him, wagging their tongues and fingers and feigning their reactions so his birthday surprise wouldn't be spoiled. In truth, they had already stacked those pillars up outside — all that remained was for them to put them up together.<!--\n              -->During their downtime, Gaming also often invites his fellow guards to take up Wushou Dance, and everyone has indeed tried it at least once on account of it \"looking totally dope,\" though almost none have persevered for long, with one of them even joking that:<!--\n              -->\"If we put suffering on a podium, we guards would get bronze, Wushou Dance masters silver, and Gaming would get gold, since he does both!\"<!--\n              -->Not wrong, in truth."

He's a mature and decent sort, and having left his home, he has earned his status and reputation without relying on anyone else.<!--\n              -->Only those aunts and uncles who saw him grow up know that he was once the notorious \"demon king\" of Qiaoying Village.<!--\n              -->If he wasn't climbing up the roof tiles, he was grabbing at the bird nests in trees, and he would go into the fields with the adults to harvest tea, to the point where his father paying damages to the neighbors for those incidents was practically routine.<!--\n              -->In truth, however, he climbed up the house beams to help his father store a private stash of Mora, and he rummaged through bird nests to help his mother collect feathers for head ornaments, and he was thrashing in the fields trying to capture pests and harmful bugs...<!--\n              -->As an oddball, Gaming's head is always full of strange, bright new ideas, leaving others quite dumbfounded, and so his parents only ever spoiled him more despite his mischievousness.<!--\n              -->Having heard that a somewhat famous Wushou Dance troupe from Yilong Wharf would be performing in Qiaoying Village, his father had handed work over to his assistants long beforehand, preparing to get Gaming one of the best seats to the watch the spectacular show.<!--\n              -->But on the day of the dance itself, he tarried too long at the tea table as he dined on dim sum with his friends, and by the time Gaming had pulled both parents before the stage, it had already been ringed by spectators thrice and thrice again. There would be no watching the Wushou Dance today, it seemed.<!--\n              -->\"Daddy's a cheat and a fibber! You said we'd go see the big Suanni!\"<!--\n              -->There was no comforting him by this point.

Check out how fierce it is!\"<!--\n              -->So saying, Gaming's father lifted the boy atop his shoulders. At that moment, the Suanni onstage leapt onto a tall pillar, and it turned and looked, locking eyes with Gaming.<!--\n              -->All at once the boy stopped crying, staring with wide eyes and open mouth at the dance taking place onstage. After the show had ended and the crowd dispersed, Gaming continued to gaze back in the direction of the stage the whole way home. Only then did his parents see that something was amiss. Could he have been frightened so by the words spoken previously?<!--\n              -->\"Ah, Gaming, no need to be scared. That wasn't a real Suanni! There were people inside, and they don't eat children...\"<!--\n              -->\"Daddy! I wanna watch the show again! I wanna be like that big Suanni. Raaaarr!\"<!--\n              -->From that day forth, Gaming, once whimsical (some might say half-hearted) in all his fancies, became utterly consumed with Wushou Dance, often badgering his father to take him to see shows, and his indiscriminate mischief-making gradually turned to (what he thought was) meticulous and well-planned Wushou Dance training.<!--\n              -->At least eight bamboo baskets became casualties of his road to mastery in lifting the beast's head, cruelly felled by kicks.<!--\n              -->As for the various rice and soup spoons that went missing around the house, they were no doubt taken to be used for drum practice, dragging not a few basins and benches down with them.<!--\n              -->Once, Gaming went with his father to purchase a batch of new tea from the farmers, when a bamboo basket was passed to him, he performed a \"Suanni's Salutation\" on reflex, raising the basket and beginning to dance. The tea leaves were scattered everywhere, and Gaming wound up being chased around the village with his father in hot pursuit. And when the father finally returned, pulling his son by the ear, their meal had already gone cold, and the mistress of the house had long been waiting expectantly at the door for their return, rattan rod in hand...<!--\n              -->In spring, autumn, winter, and summer, his parents would sit at home, his father nursing some tea and his mother snacking on melon seeds, and watch their son jump up and down, beast-head in hand...<!--\n              -->It is a pity that such days, so ordinary they could not be more ordinary, can now only return in dreams."

    "text": "Children really do change as they grow up, and that little child engrossed in watching Wushou Dance grew to become a spirited youth. The one thing that did not change was his passion for Wushou Dance, and still he dreamed of making it big in Liyue Harbor one day. But compared to Yilong Wharf, things were different there. In Liyue Harbor, Wushou Dance was seen as a new-ish folk practice that originated in Chenyu Vale — it was appreciated, sure, but it was no money-maker, and certainly not ingrained in people's hearts in the same way Liyue opera was.<!--\n              -->The more Gaming's father watched his son bustle about tirelessly, the more he worried about the youth's future, and not a few times did he speak seriously with the boy about the difficulties of starting a business. And each time, Gaming would retort that staying in business was harder yet, and declined to succeed his father in the tea leaf business. In earlier years, when his mother was still around, any impasse between the two could be broken up around the dinner table, but after she passed from illness, it was as if the glue from this father-son relationship had come unstuck, and they grew distant.<!--\n              -->Gaming's father blamed her falling ill on the immense amount of labor she had put into starting the business with him, and by extension, himself. If something were to happen to their only son, how could he ever face her? And thus, when Gaming was once again injured when practicing Wushou Dance, he could take no more, and gave all of his son's equipment away, leaving only the beast head his wife had made. To his shock, Gaming left without a word the very next day, taking said head with him.<!--\n              -->In truth, his son's departure did not only leave him angry, but also stewing in a melange of emotions and wavering reflection. He had in fact been constantly asking those close to him at the Communications Office to help take care of his son over the years, but whenever Gaming came up in conversation, his words could be brutal and blunt — nor would he put aside his pride to proactively mend relations.<!--\n              -->Leong, an assistant to the business, would write to Gaming come every festival, discussing some awkward matters that were neither here nor there — and of course, even a witless twit could guess that he was doing so at the behest of Gaming's father. Even so, Gaming was not as headstrong and free-spirited as he often appeared, and he never exposed Leong, instead going along with the letters, even asking after matters at home, intentionally or otherwise...<!--\n              -->To Gaming, reading Leong's letters was akin to defusing a bomb, and in truth, he sometimes hoped to receive nothing at all. Just as he once feared that the villagers might come and say \"Your father's on his way to give you a good whooping,\" he now feared that someone might say \"Your father was at home when he had a fall\"... Whether then or now, no news was good news.<!--\n              -->Thus did father and son continue to be stubborn, each seemingly convinced that the other would understand them in time... Gladsome was it, then, that ever-ardent Ms. Xianyun would intercede before such reticence could turn to regret. With the bridge she built, and with the aid of able allies, Gaming's father was finally able to center himself and find calm, finishing watching his son's masterful, exciting Wushou Dance performance. From awkwardness to active dialog they went, and at last, they were again able to open up to each other, with Gaming's father accepting his son's career choice.<!--\n              -->\"Well, remember to come watch next time I perform in Liyue Harbor.\"<!--\n              -->\"I don't need you to tell me that.\"<!--\n              -->\"In that case, don't chat too long over dim sum, or you might not be able to squeeze your way in when you come late...\"<!--\n              -->\"You rascal!\""

Otherwise, Mom will give me a good whacking in my dreams!\"<!--\n              -->Gaming never cries when he talks about his mother in front of others.

    "text": "A certain question had always vexed Gaming — what does a Suanni look like, exactly? Having asked his seniors, he found out that they had never seen a real one either, and they had relied on their teachers to hand down the art of Wushou Dance to them. If he really wanted to find out, it was going to be an adventure unto itself.<!--\n              -->Random chance allowed him to borrow a few old texts about the solitary Suanni hidden in the mountains from Xingqiu. Several nights did he do battle against the unfamiliar words that rushed his position like a relentless army of ants, only to be defeated at last, remembering only a few key phrases like \"fierce,\" \"majestic,\" and \"untamed.\"<!--\n              -->A giant beast of most heroic bearing indeed! He was sure that if only he could lay eyes upon it, he would gain much inspiration for his Wushou Dance performances. It was with this belief that Gaming would often poke about the locations the books mentioned. And when he came to Mt. Lingmeng, he sensed an oppressive aura about, as if a pair of eyes hidden in the bushes were watching him. This was it, Gaming intuited.<!--\n              -->Before dawn broke the next day, he made himself presentable, and brought his favorite beast head and a big bag of food offerings into the mountains. Suddenly, a strong gust blew by, and before he could react, a dark shadow had swooped about him, looping around him in circles. He immediately closed his eyes and clapped his hands together, stating his intent in a reverent and loud voice.<!--\n              -->\"O Great Suanni, Gaming greets you! I came here simply to witness your majesty... and I brought lots of good food for your enjoyment, too! Now, ah, if you don't mind, could I open my eyes?\"<!--\n              -->Hearing no more movement, he slowly re-opened his eyes, only to witness a large... difference between how he had imagined a Suanni to look and this cute little creature that sat proudly upon a giant stone.<!--\n              -->\"Whoa, seriously!? You're so tiny! And cute! Who's a good Suanni? That's right, you are! C'mon, let me give you some headpats, and...\"<!--\n              -->In his excitement, Gaming overstepped and displeased the Suanni, and though it was indeed very small, it had an extraordinary energy about it, and like a furious flame it jumped all around the young man until he grew dizzy, the items he had brought dropping from his hands. Almost unconsciously, Gaming grabbed at the beast head and began dueling the creature. What the Suanni would do, Gaming would imitate, and so they continued from daylight till dusk — to a bystander, they might even have seemed like playmates meeting again after a long separation. Finally, the Suanni seemed to acknowledge him, and as it shook its head about, a shiny stone popped out of its mane.<!--\n              -->\"Really? A Vision, too? Is this what they mean by 'good things come in pairs'?\"<!--\n              -->Carefully did Gaming approach that stone, finding it to be an absolutely real, positively genuine chunk of ore that had only shone under the glare of the setting sun.<!--\n              -->Ah, a misunderstanding, then. It was a shame, of course, but it did not dampen his mood — indeed, it was from this moment that the \"Mighty Mythical Beasts\" troupe was formally founded.<!--\n              -->From that day onward, Gaming and Man Chai were inseparable, and he quickly forgot about that whole Vision affair...<!--\n              -->Some time later, Gaming was escorting a merchant caravan when he encountered a ruthless gang of bandits. The merchants advised him to retreat — lost cargo could be written off as a cost of business, but lost lives could not.<!--\n              -->\"Hah! I've never been able to stand those who steal and rob for a living. Even if I wasn't on the job, I'd give them a piece of my mind, and as it happens, making them regret their life choices is my job and I'm on the clock. You go first, boss, and I'll hold the line here. I guarantee not one crate will be lost, nor will a single hair on your heads be harmed!\"<!--\n              -->Thus did Gaming go one against ten, and though he sustained numerous injuries, he persevered until all the brigands were bound, and both the Millelith and his colleagues had arrived, before allowing himself to slump over.<!--\n              -->The merchants would later inspect their goods, only to find that, indeed, not a single item was missing, and there was even something that had not been in the manifest — a Vision.<!--\n              -->They wrapped the item carefully before having it delivered, alongside the thank-you plaque they gave Gaming, to the Sword and Strongbox Agency.<!--\n              -->Gaming was caught completely off-guard by the gem, with only surprise and not gladness registering in his heart, which was instead overwhelmed with a series of questions.<!--\n              -->\"What, really? Is this mine? I mean, I was just escorting some goods, nothing special. I mean, don't I do that every day?\"<!--\n              -->\"Should I return it? But to whom? The caravan? No, wait, they said it wasn't theirs... Could it have been... that no-good low-down crook's?\"<!--\n              -->\"No, no, what am I thinking! Well, in that case... I guess this Vision really maybe probably might be mine, then?\"<!--\n              -->\"But I've heard that they have to do with strong wishes. I didn't get it back when I was dancing in front of Man Chai, and now I just... randomly got it on the job. Does that mean... that I was always meant to be a guard, but I was led astray by Wushou Dance?\"<!--\n              -->\"Is this a hint that I should give up on it? In that case, I'd rather not have this Vision at all!\"<!--\n              -->This lasted until he got the wrapping cloth off the plaque—<!--\n              -->And then he saw it, shaped as it was: like a beast of good omen, ears and eyes on the alert, seeing and hearing all.<!--\n              -->The defeat of these crooks, he realized, was a deed that made him akin in spirit to the monster-subjugating Suanni.<!--\n              -->Only then did the doubt clouding over Gaming's heart clear, and in response, he cleaned his hands on his clothes before accepting this Vision with all due ceremony."

Let her have the chance to see the myriad faces of the world for herself.\"<!--\n              -->Only then did her parents give her into the care of the adeptus, and time has only demonstrated the wisdom of that choice.<!--\n              -->In Liyue Harbor, Yaoyao would become a much more outgoing person with the help of her master and a host of good friends. But when the festive season comes along, she does take leave of her master to see her parents at home.<!--\n              -->Indeed, if one desired a good teacher for one's child, could there be a more ideal pick than an adeptus?"

We know little indeed of his true character, and sadly our multiple requests for an interview were all turned down. Instead, we have decided to reach out and draw upon the wisdom of the masses. In the pursuit of the truth, all anonymous submissions and attestations of manifestly questionable veracity have been filtered out. We were rather intrigued, however, by the following letter written in a particularly adorable script:\n...\n\"If the Darknight Hero really does exist, he's probably just someone in disguise. When he gets up in the morning to brush his teeth, it's the real him. Only in the dead of night does he become the Darknight Hero. But not (Monsieur) Neuvillette. The Chief Justice IS the real him. For us Melusines, our ideal of the perfect father — that's also the real him. The only person that isn't really him is the one that goes by the name of Neuvillette.\"\nFrom this, we can safely surmise... that Neuvillette must be the only male Melusine! Granted, the Melusines actually appeared much later than when Neuvillette took up his post. But in the face of such ironclad evidence, there's bound to be some way of explaining this!\"\n— Seven Nations Gazette, a notorious tabloid"

In truth, however, there are many administrative affairs that he must handle in private to keep the justice system up and running.<!--\n              -->Due to certain historical and traditional legacies in Fontaine, the Iudex also has the right to prosecute, as well as the power to enforce the law in person. This was originally intended to make it easier to maintain law and order during chaotic times, but as the system became further refined, this rule, which represented the spirit of the pioneer far more than that of the law, became maintained only symbolically. When the Iudex investigates a case or serves as the prosecutor, they must recuse themselves as judge, and have someone else take the seat. And in the few instances where he has personally investigated cases, Neuvillette has unerringly followed this rule.<!--\n              -->One thing to note is that he has been the only Iudex in the land for a very long time, so much so that people often speculate that he must have been given an unimaginably long life due to divine favor.

In all likelihood, the people had no way of understanding what it meant that the throne was shattered, or how the power of water was fully restored to its original owner. As to their being pardoned, and why they had to be forgiven in the first place, that was an even broader and more complex tale.<!--\n              -->And thus did the curtain fall — Fontaine witnessed a happy ending to the greatest drama in history.<!--\n              -->Or was it?

Before any outside life forms were ever created, all life on this planet traced its origins to the Primordial Sea.

But to Shenhe, any solution that is not the simplest and most direct one may as well not exist.For example, she almost never considers \"negotiation\" as a solution to being at cross-purposes with others, mostly resorting to \"threats\" instead. After all, it is simple and efficacious. A good solution, no?She has also spent much time ruminating on problems that are truly esoteric.For example: Why do we need to pay for food?Is there any difference between intimidating civilians and intimidating bandits?She even truly believes that her master, Cloud Retainer, is a most brilliant and eloquent conversationalist.In a certain sense, she can be considered very pure.Much like a child, she relies on her chaotic yet straightforward intuition and logic to get her through life.Mountain Shaper once had this to say about her:\"Little Shenhe is not only stronger than most — she also possesses a unique character.\"\"She knows not the world, understands not common sense, distinguishes few cuisines, and acknowledges no hierarchies.\"\"It may not be such an easy thing for Cloud Retainer to tutor her.\""

If anything, it was an experience characterized by anguish.When she was five, her mother passed away, and her father, having loved his wife dearly, found that agony hard to bear.Over time, this agony turned into resentment, and this resentment birthed obsession, by which he was driven wandering throughout the land like a man gone mad.He left for close to a year, never stopping, never able to sleep soundly, ever searching for some technique that might bring his wife back.At last, when the year was almost out, he returned in joyous frenzy.Her father had brought with him a secret art known as \"Fate Transference\"—By making a ritual sacrifice to the seelie summoned by this art, a living person's body could be exchanged for a dead one's life.At that time, Shenhe was yet utterly unaware of the disaster that would befall. She was only an ordinary child, overjoyed at her long-absent father's return.He claimed that he had a surprise awaiting her in a cave in the mountains behind and that he would take her there immediately. She was ecstatic...But the scene that followed would be burned into her mind forever.Her father summoned that hideous, horrifying black \"seelie\" into that cave, its blood-red eyes craving her delectable life-force.Stupefied, Shenhe knew not from whence it had come, nor what it wanted from this place.Crises often paralyze people. One thought only, however, crept into the young Shenhe's mind.This creature wanted to eat her, but she did not want to die. She wanted to live!Gripping her mother's keepsake, an exorcism dagger, she faced that dark \"seelie,\" trembling yet resolute...Several days later, an adeptus following the trail of great evil would investigate the cave, only to find the little girl collapsed inside — spent, famished, parched, her life hanging by a thread.Taking pity on the lass' ruinous fate, and seeing that she possessed great talent, having repelled some terrifying force on her own, the adeptus would bring her back, heal her, and instruct her in the adeptal path.If not for that, Shenhe would not be as she is today."

She was merely driven by some nebulous desire:To live in the house that was once hers, and to see what became of her father, lost in his obsession.She learned from neighbors that he had passed away several years prior only when she got there.Her childhood home had also been demolished by pawnbrokers — and thus had all the traces of her memory dissipated.She did not care about the attention she was attracting, and did not answer a single one of the questions asked by those in the vicinity.She simply stood there, listening to the howls that swept through the depths of her heart.Was it hatred? Mania? Relief?They were all there, and yet none tarried for even an instant. It was as if her heart were an old well without ripples.No, like a barren well with no water upon which there might be ripples.She stood there for a long time, before departing again before the astonished eyes of all.Each step was slow indeed, but she never once turned back."

And something strange happened then — for as the jade comb brushed through Shenhe's hair once, a layer of her black locks turned a frosty silver from root to tip.On the second brush, but half her hair remained dark.When the process was complete, only a flowing curtain of snow remained....Today, Shenhe still keeps this comb on her person as a symbol of her connection to the adepti.Through her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes:The first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret."

Hunter and hunted switched places many times, the conflict locked in stalemate...As the shadow of death loomed large, the gods looked upon the extraordinary girl with favor.With the bright, crystalline object falling into Shenhe's hands, the balance tipped irrevocably in her favor and the victor was decided.The vivid icy light pierced through the dark like skyglow, showing the path to the future.In the past, it had guided Shenhe from her miserable fate.

Even if the promise he makes is absurd, he will never break it.Be it exterminating all the dragons inside their lairs, venturing into a domain of extreme danger, or single-handedly overthrowing the territory of a nobleman...He not only keeps his promises, but does so with finesse and surgical precision.

    "text": "Ice fishing has been one of Tartaglia's hobbies since childhood.In those days, he was known neither by the names Tartaglia nor \"Childe,\" as the Fatui call him, but as Ajax, named by his father after some hero's tale. He and his father would cut holes open upon frozen lakes before sitting beside them and tending to their fishing lines.This was no easy task, and would sometimes take the entire morning.But whether it was chiseling away at the thick ice or the long waits in between catches, he was always accompanied by his father's unending tales of adventure.These were stories of his father's adventures from when he was young, and they became the future that Tartaglia secretly envisioned for himself.So he would pay close attention, putting himself into the shoes of the protagonist of those tales, immersing himself fully in them even as they waited for a fish to bite.Even after leaving home, Ajax, later to be known as \"Childe\" Tartaglia, would keep up that hobby of his.No longer accompanied by the stories of bygone days, fishing instead became an opportunity to train — to hone his endurance, and reflect on combat techniques.Such long periods of meditation to refine his skills swiftly relegated the question of a successful catch to irrelevance."

There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman...Or perhaps one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition in this boy's heart.This darkness was something that the Harbinger Childe could never again delve into.In those three months, the swordswoman taught Tartaglia how to pass through the Abyss unhindered, and more importantly, nurtured the ability to stir up endless havoc from within Ajax's trouble-mongering nature.No one knew what happened within that darkness during those three months, nor would Ajax ever speak of this to anyone.When his worried mother and sisters finally found him in that forest, only 3 days had passed in this world.Thus did Ajax's first adventure end, with his now-rusty shortsword in hand.This would mark the end of his youth and the beginning of his days as a warrior."

    "text": "By the time he returned home, the young man was no longer the same.He was no longer frightened and hesitant but had become frivolous and confident. He acted as if this world revolved around him, and as if battle existed for his sake.Conflict often brings about change, and this capricious, incalculable change attracted Ajax like a revolving kaleidoscope.In the eyes of his father, that third son that he had so worried about had changed for the worse, bringing much uncalled-for havoc to the seaside village of Morepesok.Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Ajax had become a nexus of strife, for no matter where he went, fights and squabbles would follow — and he reveled in it.Ultimately, after a huge brawl was pacified with some difficulty and with some near-fatal misses, his father had no choice but to hand his beloved son over for conscription into the Fatui.He hoped that the strict military training of the Fatui could hone his son's temper, but wound up watching fully-armed troops getting the stuffing beaten out of them by a mere child.This was a great disappointment to his father, but it also caught the attention of Pulcinella, the 5th Harbinger.Shocked by Ajax's great strength and curious about how he invariably became the eye of a vortex of discord, Pulcinella inducted Ajax into the Fatui under the pretext of meting out punishment, ordering him to start from the bottom and take up the duty of serving the Tsaritsa.His insatiable desire for conquest would thus be constantly satiated in fighting for the Fatui, and his ever-burgeoning ego would gorge upon the elation of vanquishing mighty foes...Until at last, Ajax was chosen to be one of the Fatui Harbingers, donning the mantle of \"Childe\" Tartaglia and becoming one of the most powerful people in Snezhnaya.But becoming Tartaglia was far from his end goal. To someone who sought to conquer the world, this was but a tiny step in his journey."

It's very effective, and will probably keep him from nagging for a while. It should reach you after a few days.Apart from our father's affairs, I naturally haven't forgotten about gifts for you all.This letter should come with two kites from Liyue, a rattle drum, two porcelain dolls from Inazuma, and a crate full of various snacks.And please break it to Anthon that the residents of Liyue are just boring old ordinary humans, like us.They're not made of stone, and they don't even eat stones.Do not fret for my sake, Tonia, and refrain from making trouble for anyone at home. I will be home soon. When I have seized the seven stars of Liyue and laid them at the feet of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa, I will take the first ship home, just as I promised — and you know how I always keep my promises.Yours faithfully, Your loyal knight.\""

Life in the harsh desert environment has allowed Dehya to accumulate much combat wisdom through various battles, and she is by no means your typical insolent and ignorant martial artist.\nAs long as the pay is good and the commission reasonable, Dehya is more than willing to take up her sword to defend those who hire her.\nHowever, there is one thing these employers should be aware of. That is, the agreement they establish with Dehya is only temporary and purely transactional. The reins to tame this lioness is never, and will never be in their hands.\nAlthough mercenaries sell their strength to make a living, their dignity and lives belong only to themselves.\nThe desert lioness is no one's slave, and her sword only follows her heart."

To make such a greatsword dance and flow without sufficient strength would be impossible otherwise.<!--\n              -->Secondly, she has tremendous combat instincts. It is known that the greatsword, Dehya's weapon of choice, demands a trade-off between force and speed. Should such a weapon fail to achieve a decisive first strike against a sufficiently mobile foe, it will prove more burden than a boon for the wielder. In moments like these, Dehya uses her superior insight and technique to overcome the opposition.<!--\n              -->Sometimes, she will cast her weapon aside, eschewing the edge of a sword for the weight behind her fists. She will even hurl her weapon at foes without warning to buy a fleeting opportunity.

They chittered and clamored, trying to give Dehya a vicious moniker capable of instilling debilitating terror in potential clients, usually beginning with \"bloody\" or \"terror.\"<!--\n              -->Dehya was not such an amateur as to think that a title alone might encapsulate the entirety of what others felt about her. But still, as if everyone wanted to kill some time on this matter, she didn't mind.<!--\n              -->As she listened to bad suggestion after terrible suggestion, she couldn't help but guffaw with laughter. The atmosphere reminded her of moments from her childhood when her father gathered his compatriots to put on plays for her, detailing chivalrous heroes defending the helpless or messy brawls between siblings to amuse everyone. There was no specific point to it, except to bring some cheer while surviving in the vast emptiness under the desert's midnight sky.<!--\n              -->And just as the chatting was starting to put her in a good mood, that old ne'er-do-well's shadow slid back into her mind.

Was it not all too petty to refuse such goodwill on that account?<!--\n              -->Must she avoid all the things related to her father, just because she wanted to forget him? Of course not. Besides, the story had brought a genuine feeling of warmth and comfort to Dehya, allowing her to face the world with open eyes, experience all it had to offer — and those experiences had not been falsehoods.<!--\n              -->So why not take up the title of \"Flame-Mane?\" She could have done far worse."

Like lightning or sparks of flame, she always comes and goes in the blink of an eye, igniting everything around her.\nShe pens poems by the oil of midnight and flits across mountains and seas by daylight. She appears at any time and at any place. From bustling streets to barren alleys, to derelict mountains and desolate peaks, in radiant and refulgent skies, or shadowed and starless night... Anything is possible &mdash; anything can become full of wonder.\nHu Tao is an undecipherable riddle, but people don't lament their lack of an answer. If asked, they would say, \"This is the natural order of things, right? After all, no one can outrun the wind or take hold of a flame!\"\nShe walks the line between life and death, shouldering responsibilities unknown to most mortals.\nBe careful around Hu Tao, lest she leads you by the nose!"

All of which are subject to strict rules.Regardless of their social standing and level of wealth, all who depart deserve a ceremony that would do them honor. This is the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's client service philosophy.One would think that such a reputable organization ought to be led only by an individual of utmost learning and sagacity.Yet the heavy mantle of the 77th Director has fallen on the shoulders of a young lady like Hu Tao.She has got quite a reputation in Liyue. Whenever someone mentions Hu Tao, their neighbors find it extremely hard to navigate the conversation.Although she is widely praised for her wit and shrewdness, her eccentric notions are not as welcome, as she often lets her imagination run wild.As a three-year-old, she would read through volumes of classic texts while doing handstands. At six, she would cut classes and fall asleep in coffins. When she was eight, she started living in the parlor and learning the etiquette of funeral ceremonies...One would never use the word \"measured\" to describe her behavior.During her teenage years, Hu Tao was tasked with conducting a funeral ceremony for the first time.The parlor's undertakers and consultants were anticipating her debut with their stomachs in knots as if they were suspended over the peaks of Jueyun Karst."

We have a responsibility to both parties, so we gotta make sure both sides are happy.\"When it comes to the parlor's rules, Hu Tao knows them all like the back of her hand.Each day when the parlor closes its doors, Hu Tao invites consultants from different walks of life to pass their teachings on to the undertakers.\"The funeral tradition is like science. It cannot be performed based on impressions and personal habits.\"Of all the lecturers, Zhongli is the most revered one. As such, his lessons have proven to be the most effective in cultivating the competence of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's undertakers.Despite often being teased by Hu Tao due to his old-fashioned style, he is also the person that she trusts the most.Apart from that, Hu Tao always instructs her undertakers to respect their clients' wishes and not insist on any particular form of funeral.\"Some clients want nothing more than a peaceful ceremony, some opt for a more lively style of event. There are also wealthier clients who would request a funeral arrangement of the most pompous kind. The services we provide have to be tailor-made according to the clients' needs.\"Ever since Hu Tao took over, the parlor's operations have been solid and reliable, with ceremonies conducted so tactfully that quite a few superstitious people in Liyue have changed their attitudes towards funerals.Even so, Hu Tao still has a tendency to wander off, disappearing as soon as her undertakers are busy listening to lectures.The hobbies and interests of this young director are just as eccentric as her personality, and yet it is difficult to say with certainty if those activities are of a purely leisurely nature.Hu Tao's shadow can be seen in the moonlit docks or at the highest, most precarious viewpoints in the mountains, where she's likely to take in the scenery and shape her thoughts into beautiful poetry.She loves to roam freely at night, looking for inspiration. When it strikes her, no matter where she is, she cannot help but compose a poem on the spot.If they are particularly lucky, the traveling merchants taking respite around the Huaguang Stone Forest can spot a mysterious girl keeping herself amused in solitude.Hu Tao can play a four-player card game accompanied by no one for hours on end.That said, the joys of engaging in such activities remain a mystery to all but Hu Tao herself."

At first, she examined the lions with a thoughtful look, but soon enough, her pensive face gave way to a wide smile, as she slapped them on the fore-paws.From that moment on, Hu Tao often visited and petted the stone statues. Not only would she talk to them, but also give them pet names — Whiskers for the one on the left and Mittens for the one on the right.On occasion, she would even bring a bucket of water and a big brush to bathe them, each move so careful and deliberate that one might think that they were her actual pets.As it happened, another feline, a living and breathing calico cat, could be found enjoying the local delicacies in front of Xinyue Kiosk, not too far from the ministry building. One day, some city folk came to play with the restaurant's favorite, providing an interesting foil for Hu Tao's peculiarities. Met with befuddled gazes of the bystanders, Hu Tao showed unwavering confidence.\"Sure, your kitty's cute, but the same can be said about my Whiskers and Mittens. Their fur might be harder, but they're still just as fluffy! Any animal that brings people joy may become a pet. And when it comes to majestic looks, your little fur-ball simply can't measure up to my lions!\"Suffice to say that this explanation was met with even greater consternation from the onlookers.Yet the group of people shocked the most and most often by Hu Tao's antics were the ministry guards. Soft footsteps could often be heard in front of the building at around midnight. Initially, the guards suspected that it had been a thief preparing to rob officials. To their unceasing surprise, it would turn out to just be a young lady playing with the stone lions.The guards were faced with an even bigger conundrum when, once everyone had reluctantly got used to her presence, Hu Tao discontinued her visits.That meant that the responsibility for cleaning the statues fell on the guards' shoulders once again.Subsequently, they decided to keep guard by the lions for many days, anticipating Hu Tao's return. Once they finally had the opportunity to ask her why she would not visit anymore, they received the most absurd of answers.\"Whiskers and Mittens are adults now and can take care of themselves! Excuse me, I'm running late for my heart-to-heart with a Statue of The Seven regarding the meaning of life!\""

This act of defiance against the cycle of life and death was unacceptable to Hu Tao.She wanted to bury Qiqi not only out of consideration for her friend but also to restore the natural order.But Qiqi could not disagree more, as she was afraid of death and disliked Hu Tao for her attempts.Because the struggle between Hu Tao and her had been going on for so long, Qiqi has experienced a breakthrough. She has started to remember places where she might hide to avoid being captured by Hu Tao.Perhaps it was due to those desperate survival efforts that Hu Tao decided to do something unusual and dig deeper into Qiqi's past.The story of her accident and the mystery of the adepti... That series of coincidences filled Hu Tao's heart with hesitation.Since Qiqi's will to live is so strong, she should not be forced to move on. Given the circumstances, she could only be treated as a rare exception that eludes the natural laws.Ever since, Hu Tao's attitude towards Qiqi has changed drastically, to the point that she would pamper her.Unfortunately, the damage has been done and Hu Tao has become Qiqi's bugbear.

Unfortunately, Hu Tao's anthologies, named \"Fiddlesticks\" and \"Of Common Lives\" respectively, have yet to be published.Xingqiu, ever immersed in books, also wanted to meet this strange person, and so chose an auspicious date to visit, bringing a gift with him.The two hit it off immediately, and they exchanged pointers and impromptu poetry in Wangsheng's main hall — and when faced with the poetry of Xingqiu's traditional, artistic bent, Hu Tao could always return in kind with some strange and marvelous verse.And there was meaning in the chaos, indeed, a rhythm to the bizarre that anyone could perceive, and it was catchy, too.Thus did she \"beat the old master with untrained fists,\" leaving Xingqiu at a loss for words.At length, the poetic spar ended amiably, and they have been friends ever since, reading and composing poetry with one another when they have the time to meet.Over time, Chongyun, too, was pulled in to serve as an umpire, their laughter filling the streets.The poems born from these sessions would also be recorded by bystanders.If ever you should hear a pair of matched verses, one strict and the other playful, you are most likely to have heard one created jointly by Hu Tao and Xingqiu."

When she meets others, she tells them: this hat is magical, upholding good and repelling evil, and is a bringer of peace!The undertakers laugh and leave it at that, but the 77th Director clearly does treasure that hat.No matter the rain or storm, or if Hu Tao returns late covered in muck, that hat will remain spotless and clean.The plum blossom that adorns the side of the hat is plucked from a plum tree that Hu Tao planted and grew herself.Its creation process is as follows: pluck and air-dry, then paint, lacquer, and outline carefully before sun-drying for three days and voila — a beautiful accessory, soft to the touch and bearing a delicate fragrance."

    "text": "This tale should begin with the funeral of Hu Tao's grandfather.Ten days before the funeral itself, Old Hu had passed away following a bout of illness. For its 75th Director, Wangsheng Funeral Parlor held a grand funeral, in accordance with the last wishes of the old man himself, to be conducted by Hu Tao.Only thirteen at the time, Hu Tao, who would later go on to become the Director in turn, made all the arrangements herself to the highest standard, greatly impressing the undertakers.After the funeral, the thirteen-year-old Hu Tao grabbed her traveler's bag and crept out alone in the dead of night. In her bag were only a few rations, some water, and a means to create some light. She was headed to a mysterious and seldom-seen frontier.Heading straight from Wuwang Hill, one may arrive at the \"border.\" It is the line that separates life and death, the secrets of which have been managed by Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for generations. According to legend, it is a place where the souls of past relatives and the spirits of those with unfulfilled aspirations linger. For Hu Tao, this journey was a chance to see her grandfather once more before he departed forever.For two days she journeyed unceasingly before finally arriving at her destination, yet was unable to locate her grandfather upon arrival. Between the innumerable spirits she walked, but not one of them resembled the old man.She stayed there the whole day before falling asleep in exhaustion, awakening to a night sky and heavy dew. Around her were gathered a few lone spirits, clapping and laughing:\"Silly girl, why would Old Hu be here of all places? What were you thinking, looking for your relatives here?\"Not one to be swayed so easily, Hu Tao continued to wait, day after day. Her rations gradually disappeared and her water supplies drained away, but her grandfather did not appear. In the end, it was a little old woman who came to her.She laid eyes on the exhausted Hu Tao and smiled as she spoke: \"Look at your stubbornness, you're exactly like Old Hu. It's a shame, but none of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Directors would ever linger here. You come from a family of plain speakers, so let me return the favor... Go back. Go back to where you came from.\"The old woman bid farewell to Hu Tao, before passing over the border and into the distance. Hu Tao watched as the figure of the mysterious woman grew smaller and disappeared, as a sense of doubt tinged with relief manifested itself.At last she came to the conclusion: her grandfather's absence was due to him having passed over the border as soon as he'd arrived, to the place where he was bound. He had been open and honest in life, leaving behind no regrets, so was it right for his departure to be framed in regretful terms?With a smile, she set forth on the return journey.The faraway moon had been casting a thin light on the way over but had now been replaced by the bright light of dawn. As she walked, Hu Tao thought of a saying that her grandfather had often quoted: \"Live in life, die in death. Follow your heart, do what you can.\"It was noon when Hu Tao arrived home. She climbed over the wall into the rear courtyard, went straight to her room, and unpacked her travel bag.With her food and water long gone, and the rest of her belongings unpacked, the bag she had taken for empty instead contained a colorful Vision. Just when had it arrived?As one of the few living that had dared to visit the border, perhaps Hu Tao's actions had moved some unknown god.Perhaps this then constituted a heavenly gift... the ultimate recognition of her strength."

Spry as a sparrow, she is the bearer of glad tidings from the Spina di Rosula for those in need.\nPerhaps this is why Navia has become one of the famous reporter Charlotte's favorite subjects.\nAt the exhibition hall of The Steambird, there even hangs a photo connected to her called \"The Soaring Yellow Rose.\"\nBut there's no need to worry &mdash; for it goes without saying that the photo's subject not only consented to its showing, but also gave her enthusiastic support."

The staged conflicts seemed fewer than the twists and turns at the negotiating table, and she could see the cosmetic scars imagined by makeup artists permanently carved into the bodies of those dwelling in the Fleuve Cendre.<!--\n              -->Gradually, her visits to the opera house became less and less frequent, and she instead spent more and more time on those around her. Tragedy onstage was captivating, of course, but Navia did not wish for such tales of misfortune to befall real people.<!--\n              -->How might one mediate between separated lovers mired in the battlefields of differing perspectives?

After much searching, they would at most find the barest hint of a fancy hat's rim visible on some rooftop... only for them to find naught but the hat itself upon finally climbing up.<!--\n              -->The hat's owner would at that time already be playing somewhere on Mont Automnequi. Her curiosity was so intense that she could easily enjoy and entertain herself even without any companions. Give her a pond, and she could stare at it the whole day, watching birds flapping about as they bathed in the shallows and otters rising from the bottom to do the backstroke. Just this alone could bring her great joy for quite some time, and she would give gifts in gratitude for those who brought her such happiness — millet for the birds to eat, and shells for the otters to play with.<!--\n              -->Sometimes, she would also seek out playmates. The children of Fleuve Cendre owned no toys for the most part, so she would play hide-and-seek with them, dragging her silk skirts with her through the pipes. Win or lose, she would always gain a little extra compared to the other kids. She would emerge from her hiding place brandishing a component or two she found in some nook or cranny, a few lost Mora, or a fifty-percent new portable toolbox, and bask in the admiration of her companions.<!--\n              -->Though she would often run off on her own, most of the adults were exceptionally tolerant of her behavior (her father being the exception). Spina members would help bandage her bruised knees, and the women of the Fleuve Cendre would help mend her torn clothes. Navia would think, Ah, I am loved by so many, and such thoughts would make her happier still.<!--\n              -->At one point, Navia heard an elderly lady next door say gossipingly thusly with others: \"...That girl only has her father, and he's got no time to accompany her... Poor girl, always having to roam outside by herself...\"<!--\n              -->Such words made Navia unhappy for a while. She thought herself quite fortunate. Her father loved her lots, and the adults and children around her also liked her. So why would someone regard her as one to be pitied? Perhaps, Navia thought, it was a matter of unclear communication leading to confusion. In which case, that wouldn't do, not at all.<!--\n              -->From then on, whenever little Navia felt loved, she would loudly declare: \"Thanks for liking me so much.

And it would not do for the Demoiselle of the Spina to go without a gun, for surely none would think it an ornament in her hands.<!--\n              -->Her sharpshooting skills are born of much practice, with her principle being that any stance will do so long as you hit your shots — even propping your barrel atop a Blubberbeast is fine.<!--\n              -->Clorinde, trained in the art of Marechaussee Hunter marksmanship, tends to shake her head at this, even as words of affirmation tumble out of her mouth. \"I find your optimism regarding battle is quite admirable.\"<!--\n              -->Navia takes that as praise. She met Clorinde when she was a (self-proclaimed) big girl of something over ten years, and is thus quite used to the latter's mannerisms. Yes, those are accurate words of praise, indeed!<!--\n              -->Optimism is indeed a rare psychological quality not to be undervalued. Many are those who intentionally seek to cultivate such a characteristic, yet prove unable to smile amidst life's struggles, while Navia appears to have been born with this ability. To her, there are only two types of trouble in this world: The solvable, and the unsolvable. Immediate action is the panacea to problems that can be eliminated, and as for those problems beyond one's power to change, then change yourself and learn acceptance.<!--\n              -->Apart from optimism, Navia finds tolerance to be a value that brings real improvement to one's quality of life, and it is a virtue that extends to the Spina. Why, look at all the varied business ventures, and the people of all sorts — indeed, even a Tent Tortoise calls the place home!<!--\n              -->It is said that this creature was a friend of Callas's named Consigliere, roughly meaning \"Counselor.\" Navia has also taken counsel with it in the past, finding it patient, quiet, and long-lived — just the sort of person you'd confide in. One day, Charlotte happened upon Navia babbling away to Consigliere, and out came her Kamera. The next thing anyone knew, many would come to speak to the Tent Tortoise on the picture's account. Navia herself would seek it out less from then on.<!--\n              -->\"Others should have a chance to chat with Monsieur Consigliere too,\" she would say with a straight face."

If the Spina di Rosula was more influential, a lot of things could get done more easily, but Callas stubbornly refused to accept the honorary title that the Palais Mermonia sought to grant him after the completion of the aquabus lines.<!--\n              -->Again, Callas would never intentionally hide what the Spina did from his daughter, and would speak to her of all manner of business techniques, even personally or engaging others to teach her how to use weapons, as well as bringing her to the negotiating table, as if intending to groom her to be his successor. But at the same time, he never spoke of the cause of her mother's death, nor would he ever share his feelings with her. For a time, Navia was even confused as to whether she and her father were close or distant.<!--\n              -->Later, Navia slowly came up with a theory: That her father may have treated her so to protect her. He let her learn and build up wisdom in the hopes that she would become independent and be able to survive the crushing stresses of life. As for why he would not speak of his own pressures or pain, or even Clementine's death, it was most likely to spare his daughter sorrow or unnecessary guilt. And so he remained silent, never having a heart-to-heart with his own daughter, no matter how much he missed his wife.<!--\n              -->As for his rejection of the title, this was possibly because he felt that Spina di Rosula would often be working with the common folk and a title like \"Duke Callas\" might create the perception of a difference in status between them, causing the Spina in turn to lose the trust of the people.<!--\n              -->Still, all of these are just Navia's own conclusions.<!--\n              -->This is another area where Navia found herself conflicted. She was in all things valiant, and in business straightforward, but she never did seek her father out to confirm her conjectures.<!--\n              -->—Did you make those choices to protect me, Papa? Did you underestimate my ability to sort out my feelings, even though you trusted me?<!--\n              -->She never spoke these thoughts aloud to her father. After all, she thought, they had time. Could she not wait until her stubborn old man stopped being so closed off, or until she had found better footing of her own, for them to have that conversation?<!--\n              -->It was time that would answer her question, and teach her that which her father could not.<!--\n              -->Some things in life are like that, leaving only time for on-the-spot learning and no time for preparation, just as she would go on to organize her own memos after Melus's departure.<!--\n              -->Well, everyone makes mistakes at first, right?

She soon finished reading all the thin book had to offer, and its ending was one of devastating simplicity.<!--\n              -->\"Though I have written much about our child, I suppose these are, in the end, just my own wishes.\"<!--\n              -->For some reason — their connection by blood, perhaps — Navia immediately understood the meaning of those words. Her mother had not wished for these hopes become a burden upon her growing child, and thus, her father had given this book into her keeping only after she had already grown into an adult by following her own path.<!--\n              -->That day, Navia, did something quite rare, and did not go out, instead spending a long time in her room. Equally rare, also, was her acknowledgment of her father's arbitrary exercise of authority in this case.<!--\n              -->Perhaps her mother had once intended to give her this notebook herself, once she was grown... when the time was right."

    "text": "At a birthday party many years ago, Navia took her favorite tabletop game out.<!--\n              -->Perhaps it was because this was also her coming of age, but the participants playing that day were especially numerous. Amid this lively atmosphere, everyone — apart from the birthday girl, the star of the show — racked their brains coming up with characters exceedingly ill-suited to themselves.<!--\n              -->Melus, the steady hand, became the rash and careless commissioner, inviting all present to solve — or suffer under, more like — the ancient curse afflicting his family. Sonny, ever elegant in speech and etiquette, would play a potty-mouthed petty thief, even making the grand sacrifice of shedding his pale outer coat, which usually stuck to him like a second skin. The nervous rookie, Silver, having been dragged into this by dint of passing by, was made a mighty, mysterious mage.<!--\n              -->The most lethal blow came when Clorinde, who usually took charge of proceedings, decided to \"band together\" with the famed adventurer known as \"Demoiselle\" as a private doctor who missed every shot she fired. Someone had to do the healing, she reasoned — but alas, this left the role of game master open, with Callas unfortunate enough to be the only one left to fill that post. Thus was he forced to put his soft drink aside, and leave the audience stands (the bench) for the crowd of players (the sofa).<!--\n              -->Navia was most pleased with this start.<!--\n              -->The game, however, got off to a bumpy beginning, with the strange commissioner bursting his way into Demoiselle's residence during her birthday party, only to misjudge and crash head first into a triple-layered cake, nearly drowning himself in dessert and ending the millennia-spanning family curse by his own hand within the first five minutes.<!--\n              -->Demoiselle would quickly get the good-hearted doctor to save the man, with the doctor musing if letting him live on was tantamount to helping their enemies as she rolled the dice.<!--\n              -->The game master's expression did not change as he went faithfully about his duty in a low voice:<!--\n              -->\"The young man, having braved the rain, was soaked to the bone, and both his hands were set a-trembling.\"<!--\n              -->\"He did his best to clean the cream off his face and body, though he missed a few spots.\"<!--\n              -->\"'Thank you, kind souls, thank you, for joining in my battle against this curse most wicked!'\"<!--\n              -->They were unusually lucky during the middle portion of the game. To solve a problem, one must investigate its source. According to the mage's hypothesis, the commissioner's ancestor must have made a contract with a demon for some reason. \"Ah, if I had only rolled higher, we would already know that reason...\" grumbled the mage. \"Bloody signed a high-interest contract without a care for his descendants, didn't 'e, the blithering idiot?\" The thief blurted out. \"Well then, can we steal the document and destroy it?\" Demoiselle asked offhandedly.<!--\n              -->The inexperienced game master would regret allowing their actions for all time, for the thief's luck was truly ludicrous.<!--\n              -->\"...Demoiselle was clever indeed, and the thief just as profoundly skilled.\"<!--\n              -->\"No one thought that the contract would fall into their hands so easily, and yet the words written upon it were nigh indecipherable...\"<!--\n              -->The ending, too, was unusually happy. Thanks to the hardworking and kind (and also sufficiently rusty) game master, Demoiselle would finally drag the rest of the party, riddled as they were with status effects, into a confrontation with the ancient demon. The battle was as chaotic as ever, with the mage losing his sanity first, and the doctor not landing a single shot. But just as everyone's hit points were about to bottom out, the adventurer Demoiselle would hazard a venture. Using up a turn to move beside the demon, and tanking a full round of its attacks head-on, she knowingly gave the doctor a desperate order, as everything was going to hell: \"Shoot me instead!\"<!--\n              -->The doctor's dice were rolled before the game master could say anything. Callas counted the dice in silence, before taking three deep breaths.<!--\n              -->\"...The bullet pierces the demon’s weak spot, and the giant creature collapses into the abyss.\"<!--\n              -->\"It returns to the darkness, and into slumber, taking that absurd curse with it.\"<!--\n              -->\"Rejoice, rejoice, for the adventurer's courage and for her ill-omened ally!\"<!--\n              -->Perhaps it was to go with the President's flow or out of genuine emotion, but there was indeed much rejoicing. Amidst the din, only Callas, who had begun to sort out the various items used for play, was stunned. He retrieved a golden-yellow jewel from within the dice box.<!--\n              -->\"Navia... I think this is yours.\"<!--\n              -->There were many people present, but this Vision did indeed belong to Navia, for it was with a flash of her thought that a great blade of Geo would slice her birthday cake in two... along with the table.<!--\n              -->Later at night, when the party and her excitement both had settled down, Navia would lie on her bed, unable to remember what she had been thinking when she had obtained the Vision. Had her mind lingered on the final victory, obtained only after much struggle and hardship? Or had she wished that her birthdays henceforth would be spent surrounded by friends, just like this one?<!--\n              -->If it was the former, that seemed to obliquely indicate that a happy ending must be preceded by many tribulations... so best to go with the latter.<!--\n              -->Thus were her thoughts as she lay at dreamland's door, still clutching the Vision."

    "text": "The story of how Barbara obtained her Vision is hardly the typical tale of high-stakes heroism.She had just joined the church and was looking after a little boy with a high and persisting fever.Nothing Barbara could think of would console the boy and bring an end to his relentless tears.Someone remarked that while the boy had already taken his medicine, there was no way to cure the pain of missing one's family.Another suggested that Barbara sing a song for the boy to raise his spirits.Barbara had never sung a song in her life up until this point, but how could she shy away from it in a moment like this?\"Never having sung before is no reason to abandon a child in their time of need,\" Barbara thought to herself.And so, Barbara took the boy in her arms and sang him a song: a lullaby, the only song she knew.It was an unceremonious beginning to her singing career. After quickly realizing that she barely knew any of the words, she had to resort to humming the tune instead.Nevertheless, her voice began to soothe the child, and so she kept singing. She sang the same song, over and over again, until her throat was dry and her voice was hoarse. Finally, the boy fell asleep. Exhausted, Barbara lay down by the wall and fell straight asleep herself.Early the next morning, Barbara awoke to discover that the boy's fever had come down. Perhaps it was because she had sung for him, or perhaps it had something to do with the Vision which had mysteriously appeared next to her hand at some point during the night.Barbara was not preoccupied with the Vision, however. It was the sight of the boy smiling once again that filled her heart with joy.Barbara received her Vision for the simple but beautiful wish that took hold in her heart that night: A dream of healing the sick through the power of song."

As such, Yun Jin started learning the opera early.However, Liyue Opera is a complex art that takes years of perfection to master.So even for a child as gifted as Yun Jin, what awaited her was sweat and tears. While ordinary children might shy away from the pain of hamstring stretches and the tedium of memorizing lyrics, little Yun Jin hung tough and became quite accomplished.By the time she finished all the subjects in Liyue Opera, veterans of Yun-Han Opera Troupe who watched her grow up couldn't help but exclaim,\"Yet another rising opera star is about to shine upon Liyue Harbor!\""

She finds that rock 'n' roll vibrates with vigor and even became friends with the rock 'n' roll musician Xinyan.Elders of the troupe are glad to follow Yun Jin's lead during rehearsals, but when it comes to daily life, they treat her like their little granddaughter.\"Sweetie, listen to us. No spicy food, it hurts your voice. Meat is fine, but refrain from eating too much, or you will put on weight.\"\"If you really can't help yourself, have more shrimp. Stay away from the... roll 'n' roll thing. All they know is yelling.\"These caring elders will nag Yun Jin about attending rock 'n' roll performance for hours on end.Faced with the impossible mission of persuading stubborn granddads and grannies, Yun Jin has to be creative.While it's not an option to go to Xinyan's performance, it's perfectly acceptable to visit Fan Er'ye's adopted daughter Xingyan and discuss Liyue Opera with her.The elders are not fond of the rock star Xinyan, but they have taken a shine to Xingyan the adopted daughter of Fan Er'ye.\"I've heard that Xingyan can cook and do embroidery. She must be a polite and accomplished young lady. Yun Jin may be able to pick up a thing or two from hanging out with her. How capital!\"Yun Jin has long got Fan Er'ye to agree on the details concerning the made-up Xingyan, so don't worry. No one's gonna call her out on this!"

Though there are managers to help with everyday work, Yun Jin is the one who makes the big decisions. She thus earned the name of Director Yun from people in business circles.As for Sir Yun, that is another story.When Yun Jin's grandfather was in charge of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe, long-time fans respectfully addressed him as Sir Yun. After Yun Jin took charge later, these fans frequented her performances as well.There was once after a show when an impressed fan half-joked with others, \"the Sir Yun we have now sings rather well too.\"A voice from the crowd immediately countered by saying: \"How can you address a young girl as Sir?\"Upon hearing this, Yun Jin curved her lips.\"Those who were born early, learn early. They are naturally better-informed than others. It's every bit right for them to be referred to as Sirs.\"\"But one doesn't have to be old to be knowledgeable. Besides, why can't a girl be knowledgeable?\"\"You are quick in mind and speech, and are thus qualified to be called Sir. I have answered your eminent question — that also makes me a Sir.\"Her remarks impressed the fans present, who shared this story to many.

Thus, stories portraying them make up the majority of the repertoire of Liyue Opera.When Yun Jin was young, she would find these stories engaging, but having exhausted every adeptal legend in her performing career, her take on theming gradually changed.Why not experiment with other themes? For instance... stories of our own, perhaps?Stories that tell of our earthly joys and sorrows, songs that sing of the hatreds and passions of humanity.Maybe these stories of mere mortals may not make it as classics of Liyue Opera, but there will always be some people who remember them.In love our thoughts linger, in rage our hearts burn, and in obsession, our minds go astray. These emotions, good or bad, lift the veil that covers our feelings and souls.Yun Jin is no adeptus. She can never put herself in the shoes of the adepti, yet she is endowed with the most accurate and sensitive grasp of human emotions.\"So, let me sing of human stories. May my brush be the brush of all hearts and my voice the voice of all souls.\"This is the unspoken wish that Yun Jin has so far only kept to herself."

By the time it came to Yun Jin's generation, few of the Yuns still practiced the art of forging.Many forged things have been passed down, though. The lock-shaped copper pendant that Yun Jin carries with her is one such item.In her childhood, she often practiced dancing for a whole day under the scorching heat of the sun. Sometimes, she would even faint from the exhaustion.Her parents' hearts ached for her, but they knew well that she had to go through such things to lay a solid foundation.So instead of stopping her, they gave Yun Jin the lock in the hopes that it would keep fortune and health within her.Since then, the lock has never left Yun Jin's side. Before every performance, it is a routine for Yun Jin to reminisce about those days of bittersweet training by cleaning the lock with great care.It feels as if she was caressing the devoted heart of the little Yun Jin who was learning the opera."

However, the more she played, the more she felt at a loss — these were not the operas she wanted to perform.In every opera, the pitch and tempo would invariably go either up or down to indicate drama or doldrum.As time passed by, the visage of the various characters seemed to blend and blur.The music would come on, followed by a neat dance, and then her sweet voice. The girl in \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation\" seemed no different from the fisherman's daughter in \"String of Pearls.\"While the audience did not object, Yun Jin was not satisfied. \"Is skillful singing and dancing all it takes to tell a moving tale?\"What broke her bottleneck was an opera named \"Snow Treading.\"It was a monodrama about a strenuous walk in the snow. It happened to be a snowy day when Yun Jin first performed the opera.Having gone astray in the snow, the character felt lost and lamented her helplessness. Somehow, the snow in the story seemed to fall into reality. Yun Jin, who had also found herself adrift, felt as if she had become her character.That was what she had been looking for, the feeling of leaving herself behind and walking in the shoes of the many characters she played.To breathe, to live, and to smile just like them.That was the opera she had wanted to sing, the story she had wanted to tell — one about true emotions, a world built on tens of thousands of individuals who live lives of their own.Yun Jin could no longer recall how she returned backstage after the epiphany. All she knew was that when she finally had time to take off her costume, she found a Vision in her sleeve."

Using the network of information and connections that he has personally built up over the years, he can gain any intelligence or resources he needs from the comfort of his office.<!--\n              -->However, he is also aware of one principle, which is that he cannot be imprisoned in that office by the host of duties that assails him, or he will either never get a good night’s sleep, or soon find himself sleeping forever beneath the waves.<!--\n              -->Only two things are necessary for him to run this place comfortably: Mora and manpower.<!--\n              -->Fortunately, the Fortress itself is a giant factory, and he has quite the knack for making money — why, even the Palais Mermonia is one of his valued customers. Very importantly, giving the Palais some extra care is not considered to be hankering after power, and the Court of Fontaine for its part has little power of oversight over the Fortress, and thus simply represents valued customers and Mora — the more of both, the better. As such, Wriothesley is happy to comply with the Maison Gestion’s exhaustively strict demands for proper documentation.<!--\n              -->(The Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering's incredible demand for Arkhium might have once made it a match for the Palais, but ever since the Institute became a mid-air tourist attraction, it has been forced to withdraw from the partnership. Till we meet again for another big contract, valued customer.)<!--\n              -->One of the most common pitfalls for the immensely wealthy is over-valuing money and undervaluing people. This is, again, where Wriothesley is a fortunate man, for he was not born rich, and thus knows how important it is to get along with others.<!--\n              -->He treats all who live at the Fortress equally. Be they criminals, guards, or ordinary staff, so long as they do what they should as they should, he will not nitpick.<!--\n              -->But as for those who overstep their station — well then, words must be had. The underwater space they dwell in is quite enclosed, and for most, there is nowhere else to go. If possible, of course, Wriothesley would prefer everyone to be reasonable, but where reasoned words fail, he will use even more persuasive means.<!--\n              -->Occasionally overlooking the trivial, meaningless, but inevitable clashes between people is fair enough. Most people know better than to raise a real stink, while as for those who don’t... there are places where they can go. Just as flowing water can cleanse itself, so can a functioning society get rid of its rot.<!--\n              -->As such, not only has Wriothesley not been worked into oblivion, he has even found himself significant amounts of free time.<!--\n              -->Once, the famous Champion Duelist Clorinde paid him a visit, and said this in passing: \"Why does it feel like you have even more free time than me? Your title wasn’t bought, was it?\"<!--\n              -->\"One moment, please.\"<!--\n              -->So saying, Wriothesley rifled through three drawers before producing several thick documents with a flourish. \"Now, let me see...

That idle exchange between Wriothesley and Clorinde was pure nonsense, just a bit of verbal horsing around to liven up an otherwise bone-dry business interaction.<!--\n              -->However, while the title of \"Duke\" itself was not bought, Wriothesley's accession to administrator of the Fortress of Meropide cannot be separated from \"money.\"<!--\n              -->Credit Coupons serve the role of currency within the Fortress. Here, Coupons are the medium of exchange, and this has been the case for a very long time, with only the details differing. When Wriothesley was incarcerated here as an inmate, trade in Coupons was much freer, and the range of items that could be bought more comprehensive. So long as you had enough of them in your pocket, you could obtain harmful drugs, know the winner of fixed matches, buy the hearts of people sitting on the fence, and even take away the right of others to continue breathing.<!--\n              -->Many of these were extralegal trades, but even the official channels had their various special tricks, too. If you lacked private connections, you could only buy food and water at exorbitant prices, and your fortune slip would not be some adage of unknown providence, but real, practical, extra work you had to finish by the end of the workday. Coupons in those days resembled nothing so much as the previous administrator's tool for controlling inmates.<!--\n              -->Hurling lawbreakers into a lawless chaos to fend for themselves was indeed one way of doing things, but Wriothesley could not approve of it. He was perfectly willing to adapt to his environment, but if the environment was not suited for survival in the first place, then he certainly wasn't going to take this lying down.<!--\n              -->He spent a great deal of time accumulating capital in the underground arena and used that money to make still more. He was always the observant type, and was quite persuasive, too, not to mention humble and reasonable — so before anyone knew it, he had already accumulated more Coupons than everyone else in the Fortress combined.<!--\n              -->This accumulated wealth made him a man of high repute amongst his fellow inmates. And just as Wriothesley expected, the hammer of punishment soon came swinging down. In a single night, his Coupon account was emptied in one cruel stroke by the Fortress's administrator.<!--\n              -->But as noted before, Wriothesley had a knack for convincing others. Words have the power to incite, and so long as all residents of the Fortress, rich and poor, understood that they could suffer a similar fate under such management, they would speak up for him. And if he acted in a sufficiently upright manner in a sufficiently impressive setting, others would join with him to fill the void in their hearts.<!--\n              -->As such, he challenged the Fortress' previous administrator to a duel, in the name of fairness, justice, and order. Of course, their respective standings made poor grounds for this fight even at the best of times, but on that day, not a soul, inmate or guard, said a word in protest.<!--\n              -->Very fortunately, said administrator's last-minute flight saved Wriothesley from having to get another person’s blood on his hands. But unfortunately, that day was also the day he would have finished serving his sentence, but with the administrator missing, there was no one to sign his exit papers.<!--\n              -->And so, he walked into the office in the middle of the Fortress, and took over all relevant duties."

According to the accounting ledger of his host family, he had been taken in as an abandoned infant — beyond that, there was no more relevant information.<!--\n              -->While browsing through his file, Wriothesley encountered some names that he had vague impressions of, and some other foggy faces briefly floated into view before fading to the sound of turning pages. Had he been willing, he could have used his connections to discover how these old companions were faring, but he dismissed those thoughts even as they entered his mind.<!--\n              -->To them, he must represent a past they no longer wished to recall, and to him, these names no longer constituted any part of his life. He had a new identity, a new home, and new friends.<!--\n              -->This was a strange experience for him. He'd met and known many people, and of all of them, very few could be considered friends — and he even knew quite a few who weren't human at all, something he puts down to Melusines really enjoying hanging out with humans. Their appearance belies their age, but the goodwill they show humans truly does have an innocence that only one's elders may have, a belief that these young human souls are good-hearted to begin with, and thus worthy of all care and faith in the infinite possibilities their futures hold.<!--\n              -->Wriothesley himself has benefitted from this many times. When he was out on the streets with only the clothes on his back, it was a passing Melusine who gave him some hot soup. When he did not return completely unharmed from his bouts in the ring, Sigewinne would be waiting to greet him cheerily in the infirmary — not to mention how the officers of the Marechaussee Phantom have always been, within legal limits, his greatest help in investigating certain secret affairs.<!--\n              -->As such, he tacitly permits their visits to the Fortress, even if this can sometimes mean unneeded trouble. As for anything they might need to know, the Head Nurse warns them, and there's no need to go into details.

Indeed, he could not move a muscle if he tried. Thought and warmth had both faded, and his mind had begun to fill with a seeping, murky fog — there was nothing in his life till now worth remembering.<!--\n              -->But he did not die. Fate, it seemed, wanted him to live with the burden of sin, and so when he woke up in his hospital bed, both of his hands had been cuffed to the metal rails. A well-dressed woman was looking at him nervously from her distant chair. No doubt, she considered him to be some manner of young psychopath.<!--\n              -->Producing pen and paper, she asked for his name, and he paused for a good long time.

He didn't particularly like it, but he no longer wished to use the one his foster parents had given him.<!--\n              -->Thus did the woman write \"Wriothesley\" down, and inform him of his trial date (which was, would you know it, the day the doctors expected him to be able to get out of bed), before hurriedly taking her leave.<!--\n              -->The trial itself went very smoothly, which he was grateful for. The blood he had spilled had stained his hands and taken root in his heart, driving him to yearn for a just conviction.

Argue they still did, though, first on the matter of past cases related to orphans in an inconclusive search for any precedent patterns, and then somehow for clemency, believing that the people he'd taken vengeance on were villains themselves in the first place, and that he should thus not have to bear the burden of guilt.<!--\n              -->This background noise did not change the ultimate result of the trial, and no sooner was it over than he was sent beneath the sea to serve time.

As such, he was forced to try his luck on the streets, picking up odd jobs and doing apprenticeships, learning the art of lockpicking and the creation of small gadgets. He wanted to make sure that he would be well-equipped when he finally returned to destroy that accursed place.<!--\n              -->He fashioned a wrist-mounted device that could launch iron nails at high speed, penetrating any sufficiently soft surface. Unfortunately, it had limited uses, and lost all ability to function after a battle, just like him — and unlike him, it could not be saved.<!--\n              -->In the past, the underground pankration fights of the Fortress of Meropide had neither a fixed venue nor set rules.

That was hard to say.<!--\n              -->At that point, he no longer participated in matches all that often, with the gauntlets being saved for dealing with the trickiest of problems.

He spent very little time in there, finding afterward that his skin had flushed a slight red tint, though it returned to normal shortly afterward. He did not go to the infirmary for a checkup, nor did he intend to reveal this to anyone. All manner of recent signs had indicated that the prophecy was gradually coming to pass, and all people, regardless of whether they believed in it or not, had their own views on the matter, and did not really need this extra information.<!--\n              -->He had encountered some inmates with academic research backgrounds, though their numbers were relatively few, and they were prone to mad babbling even when clear-headed. They called this a malady common to all historians, and begged his forbearance in the matter. Wriothesley, of course, did not mind, and indeed, he was very interested in their arguments. And according to some schools of thought, if rising and falling were common in this world, then that great sea that once swallowed Remuria may perhaps return someday. In that sense, the prophecy was not really a prophecy, then, but was instead the expression of a rational pattern.<!--\n              -->As with many other things, he was somewhat on the fence about this reasoning.

As such, he would reserve judgment on all records, and especially historical chronicles, for was poetic exaggeration not common practice in such writing? \"Even the great dragon beneath the abyssal depths submitted to his power...\" And how was anyone to know if this so-called great dragon was not just some very large vishap?<!--\n              -->Once all embellishments were removed, what still remained were the actual things he needed to take note of.<!--\n              -->Throughout his as-yet unfinished life, Wriothesley has always seemed to be preparing for something. No matter what, he does not wish for people to be ruled by terror. And once the personal element of fear has been removed, what remains is something more akin to a sense of danger. He would like to make some preparations in response to the crisis, even if it might prove futile in the end.<!--\n              -->History is, after all, vast and terrible, and humanity is no more than seashells to be smashed upon the seashore by its great waves. Thus, he began to prepare for the creation of the Wingalet, expending vast resources and employing much manpower, though he did not put more stock into its success. It was a ship designed for fleeing disaster — an insurmountable chasm lay between it and golden Fortuna, bringer of civilization and glory.<!--\n              -->Nonetheless, if it could indeed serve its purpose, Jurieu and Lourvine's many quarrels would not have been for naught.<!--\n              -->\"Thusly do the ancient writers concur — 'Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change.'\""

Wriothesley blinked. When had he come into possession of this?<!--\n              -->The person at the desk — a stern-looking lady with a wrinkled face — gasped, before steadying her shocked expression, gripping her pen tighter. Her lips moved, and moved again, but at last closed.<!--\n              -->\"She must have a lot of experience about living here,\" he immediately thought, and so he did his best to hold the Vision in his palm, before asking in a small voice, \"Miss, may I ask...\"<!--\n              -->The senior registrar did not reply. She took the slip of paper from him and looked coldly behind him, as if sizing up the next criminal who'd come to register. However, when she had finished filling the necessary information in, she had written something unnecessary in the margins of the documents she passed back to him. \"Hide it well.\"<!--\n              -->Wriothesley realized immediately that life at the Fortress would be even harder than roaming the streets.<!--\n              -->He felt fortunate that he had blocked everyone behind him from seeing what had happened, and more fortunate still that this kind-hearted registrar had been willing to give him a reminder. Sadly, he would not see her again, though this was no surprise, since staff turnover at the Fortress was quite high in those days.<!--\n              -->The first thing he did upon officially entering the Fortress was to quietly unravel a few threads of his clothing before using fine wire to sew his Vision into the space between the layers of fabric.<!--\n              -->He knew a thing or two about being homeless — certainly, that the biggest problem was never getting a hold of resources, but keeping them. People could not avoid sleeping, and occasionally being defenseless. The things you owned could be taken away with ease once you were asleep, and no one would call it a robbery.<!--\n              -->And a Vision was no ordinary treasure. There were sure to be those who would be interested in it for various reasons, and Vision wielders were often magnets for ill-intentioned gazes.<!--\n              -->In the days that followed, his suspicions would be verified, for in gossip alone he heard of two to three Vision thefts. As for what happened afterward and the fate of the victims, various inconsistent rumors existed that Wriothesley pretended to pay little mind to.<!--\n              -->He still felt quite fortunate, of course, but it was hard to feel genuine happiness at staying safe off the backs of other peoples' tragic fates.<!--\n              -->For a long time afterward, he would pretend that he had not been favored by the gods, and in truth, it was not hard — merely a return to his scrappy past. He could handle that much.<!--\n              -->This persisted until a time when his age had nearly doubled, and he received an official invitation from the Palais Mermonia.<!--\n              -->Common practice dictated that citizens who were to receive an honorary title must attend an investiture ceremony, and said ceremony was said to be far more involved for the granting of a title such as \"Duke.\"<!--\n              -->Wriothesley tactfully declined attending the ceremony on the grounds of his unique duties, expressing the desire to simply sign and take the relevant certificates. Quite un-Fontainian of him, really, to dislike the spotlight and prefer to just muddle along.<!--\n              -->Many workdays and much correspondence later, the Palais finally agreed.<!--\n              -->Before leaving the underwater stronghold, Wriothesley took his Vision up once more, for the first time in many years. Weighing it in his palm, he found it lighter than before, and smaller to boot. Finding a good spot on his clothes, he hung it there.<!--\n              -->The first to comment on it was the Iudex, who was to bestow the title upon him. Neuvillette’s smile was suitably polite, but he somehow seemed more pleased than Wriothesley himself. \"Congratulations,\" said the Iudex. \"You have found something you wish to do at last, I see.\"<!--\n              -->Wriothesley smiled back by way of reply, but made no further comment."

And the heads of those organizations are all smart people, so they would jump at an opportunity like this, that's for sure...\nAs folks stood around on the street, chatting idly, a little cat named Ashru quietly walked past behind them.\nIn his mouth, he carried a letter from the hand of Boss Nefer.\nThe intended recipient of this letter, however, was not one of those smart persons."

They would rather face caged monsters or some malicious spell, for at least then, there might be some real satisfaction to be had.<!--\n              -->And yet, whenever Miss Nefer receives them, she speaks in a tone most ordinary, calmly brewing tea as if she had never personally destroyed a gang, led a certain boss to ruin, or ever sparked conflict between any rival factions. As if she were not the unseen hand stirring the waters of Nod-Krai, keeping them just the right degree of murky...<!--\n              -->Once, a trembling young man drew his blade against her. In his foolishness, he declared that no matter how meticulous a schemer Nefer was, she was still flesh and blood, and all he needed was one moment of reckless courage to bring her down...<!--\n              -->The owner of the Curatorium paid no heed to the feeble threat. Instead, she commended him with a small smile. At the very least, he alone had followed his heart and dared to draw steel. The others before him had spoken of revenge, but in truth had hidden behind hollow bravado, hoping to use such posturing to bargain for petty profit.<!--\n              -->For his foolish — yet admirable — show of bravery, Nefer was willing to tell the young man what kind of person could truly walk the path of victory.<!--\n              -->There are indeed many powerful figures in Nod-Krai. Some command vast wealth, others possess fearsome reputations. Yet none of them can emerge as the ultimate victor.<!--\n              -->Their names and fortunes have become shackles, making them hesitant and overly cautious, afraid that any wrong move might shatter some precious bauble.

Their unease about the Curatorium stemmed largely from an instinctive fear of the unknown.<!--\n              -->However, children don't tend to think that deeply. What they remember is how kind and pretty Big Sister Nefer is, with her lovely voice and gentle manner. They remember the candy she gave them and the fascinating stories she has told — stories that, while a little scary, were still far more entertaining than the adults' lectures.<!--\n              -->...The lady in green is the owner of the Curatorium of Secrets and is a good person, so... the Curatorium must be a good place, too!<!--\n              -->As a result, the first ordinary client to visit the Curatorium was a tearful little girl who would only stop crying after being comforted by a certain permanent staff member there. In between sobs, she explained that her parents had said they were going out on business, but they hadn't come back. As such, she wanted to ask Miss Nefer to help find them.<!--\n              -->The girl's small wish was quickly granted. Once the clues were found, the young lady with the metal arm acted swiftly and decisively, rescuing the couple from the bandits who had taken them captive.

In truth, this river has conquered all its tributaries, commanding them to merge their waters with its own. In its darkest depths, the merciless currents surge stronger than ever, dragging things that should never surface down to the bottom, burying them deep beneath mud and pebbles.<!--\n              -->Only one person can uncover the river's true secrets.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->\"Boss, can't you send Ashru to look for the cats next time? I don't speak cat, you know...\"<!--\n              -->The girl with the metal arm bounced into the Curatorium with a pout on her face.<!--\n              -->Nefer closed the ledger and watched as Ashru leaped onto the table, settling down and rolling over contentedly under the vigorous petting of the Curatorium's sole permanent employee.<!--\n              -->\"Tsk! You get to eat all this cat food every day without lifting a paw. Next time, I'm taking you out on field duty!\"<!--\n              -->\"Meow! Meow meow meow!\"<!--\n              -->The sunlight outside the window was perfect.

Nefer's proposal, in truth, had exceeded his expectations. He had merely hoped the Curatorium's owner would help locate a certain traitor so that the appropriate punishment could be meted out. But at the meeting, he learned that she had already arranged for their target to visit the Curatorium for some business three days later, giving them the perfect opportunity to act.

She still remembered how he boasted of laboring across three moons such that he might guide the benighted mortals below, weaving reasonable threads of fate for all living things, such that life on earth could sprout anew in cycles. He had also told her how, upon arriving in Sumeru, his talents were recognized by the discerning King Deshret. He claimed that he was then elevated to lead the great \"Seven Pillars of King Deshret,\" that he drank the wine of revelry with the king himself, and that he once planted greenery alongside the Goddess of Flowers. In short, if Nefer were to accept his grace, she would gain extraordinary power.<!--\n              -->Nefer didn't believe these tales for a moment, absurd as they were. To her, they were nothing more than lies hastily spun by an old trickster trying to win her trust. After all, King Deshret had exiled three sycophantic courtiers to Aaru. Would it not have been all too easy for the trio, extraordinary as they nonetheless were, to come together in the time since and weave a story meant to deceive the unsuspecting?<!--\n              -->\"Will you truly refuse to believe anything?\" Thoth, inhabiting the cat’s body, asked angrily. The cat's fur bristled, not from conscious effort, but simply because cat fur naturally stands on end when they're upset.<!--\n              -->\"If a deity wishes to deceive people with their wisdom, the people will surely be deceived,\" Nefer responded with a shrug. \"So I won't believe a single word you say either.\"<!--\n              -->\"But the power you're about to give me?

The Fortress has changed hands in chaotic circumstances several times over the centuries, but there has always been a tacit agreement amongst all who live here not to harm the medical staff in any way.\nThe reason for this is simple — few doctors could endure treating criminals and staying in such a place for long.\nFewer still would be as clement, cute, conscientious, and considerate as Sigewinne.\nThere was once an inmate whose life Sigewinne saved after he had been gravely injured while causing trouble, who then proclaimed her to be an emissary of the heavens — an \"angel of salvation\" — sent to bring redemption to criminals, even saying that he would preach this far and wide on her behalf.\n\"That's a bit much, isn't it?\" The head nurse shook her head, her long ears bobbing along.\n\"I won't ask what you did wrong before saving you, but you'll still have to finish serving your sentence once you've healed up,\" she said, hands on hips. \"Flattery's not getting you anywhere!\""

    "text": "Within the huge undersea facilities of the Fortress of Meropide, Sigewinne's infirmary is one of the few places open to all people at all times.<!--\n              -->A guard might have a terrible bout of illness while out on patrol at night, and have to be helped over to the infirmary by his colleagues, only to find that a hot drink and a clean bed had already been prepared, awaiting his arrival. Or an exhausted inmate might collapse from overexertion at their lunch desk, then awake to find their meal by their bedside, snug within an insulated container...<!--\n              -->As they made these discoveries, Sigewinne's smile would also come into view, swiftly relieving both fright and fatigue, helping them to calm down and accept treatment and care.<!--\n              -->All are in awe of her dedication, yet are also puzzled by the warmness of her heart.<!--\n              -->To be consigned to the Fortress is a punishment in and of itself, and even the most youthful and energetic of guards must take a day off after consecutive days of work. Yet Sigewinne has taken precious few of these throughout Wriothesley's entire tenure as administrator. The lights in the infirmary are always on, and it seems that they'll never be put out... The motivation behind such enthusiasm may as well be an enigma to guard and inmate alike.<!--\n              -->\"Could it be that she is an emissary sent from the heavens to watch over us?\"<!--\n              -->What began as a single inmate mumbling away to themselves after seeing the wings on Sigewinne's back was swiftly taken up others, until before long the vast majority were behind it. In this world without light beneath the waves, she had become their \"sun,\" bringing a radiant warmth to their dark, damp prison.<!--\n              -->To repay this \"angel\" for her care, the guards have an \"unwritten rule\" beyond the many administrative systems already present — any who are rude to Sigewinne are punished extra harshly. The inmates, for their part, also have an unspoken agreement that any particularly wild and violent newcomers must receive a \"warning\" upon being admitted. After all, they had to be made aware that the community would brook no affront to their angel, didn't they?<!--\n              -->Sigewinne herself is blissfully unaware of all these customs that have cropped up around her, and simply serves her patients as she always has. However, there will always be some curious person who will ask:<!--\n              -->\"Head Nurse, why do you stay here to take care of us? Don't you get tired or, y'know, annoyed?\"<!--\n              -->Whenever this happens, Sigewinne's brows tend to furrow (a rare sight indeed), as though the question was absurd.<!--\n              -->\"Hmm... Have you ever had a pet cat? You take care of them, and watch them be cute in their various ways... That's something that makes you happy in and of itself, isn't it? Why would anyone ever get tired of something like that?\"<!--\n              -->Most who ask cannot quite believe their ears when they receive such an answer, and those they tell are even less convinced.<!--\n              -->\"Nonsense, if ever I've heard it! I'd sooner believe that angels exist!\""

    "text": "In the days just following Sigewinne's appointment to the post of Head Nurse, the Fortress saw many instances of inmates overworking themselves.<!--\n              -->Even without being ordered to do so, many would persist in working when rest times rolled around. Perhaps they were simply looking for a faster way to get their hands on temporary luxuries to lavish upon themselves, or place another bet in the next boxing match — either way, the Credit Coupons caused many an inmate to sacrifice their health in pursuit of their desires.<!--\n              -->Seeing all this confused Sigewinne, yet she was unable to do anything about it. The way she saw it, \"exhaustion\" was an \"illness\" that humans actively sought to afflict themselves with.<!--\n              -->\"But since it is an illness, I could come up with a cure, couldn't I?\"<!--\n              -->So thinking, she began sourcing for ingredients, eventually coming up with a type of medicine that was to her satisfaction. Both packed full of nutrition and delicious, in her eyes it was a sure-fire winner.<!--\n              -->Yet when she first tried to use it, the inmate she was treating blanched in terror at the sight and refused to take it.<!--\n              -->Bewildered by this reaction, Sigewinne sought help from many sources, eventually receiving her answer from the inmate who served as head chef.<!--\n              -->\"Sounds like a piece of cake to me! We chefs can turn anything into a gourmet dish, even the ugliest-looking roots and rhizomes around.\"<!--\n              -->Though she found herself disagreeing with his definition of \"ugly,\" Sigewinne was grateful for the head chef's help, and so she showed him the ingredients she had prepared.<!--\n              -->There was a long silence as the head chef looked over the items before him.<!--\n              -->\"Head Nurse, I will do my best. Oh, and if you don't mind, next time you send me the ingredients... Don't let anyone see them, alright?<!--\n              -->Sigewinne did not understand why he was so worried, but seeing his earnest gaze, she agreed. Afterwards, she was to give this medicine the official name of \"Nutritious Meal,\" and thus did it become one of the secret menu items at the canteen — one that would inevitably show up on an inmate's tray the day after they overworked themselves."

    "text": "After Sigewinne became Head Nurse, the fact that she looked like a human yet was actually a Melusine became an open secret, and the news spread even beyond the Fortress's walls.<!--\n              -->Some guessed that she might be a descendant of mixed human and Melusine blood, but any who discussed this possibility would receive a stern warning from the Marechaussee Phantom. Even Iudex Neuvillette would personally come out against such rumors, \"with the intent to quash such inappropriate, discourteous canards.\"<!--\n              -->Some guessed that she might be wearing a special mask and gloves, postulating that this made it easier for her to blend in with humanity. But most quickly refuted this belief, for the time when humans had ostracized Melusines was now far behind them, and there was no need for Sigewinne to live in this way.<!--\n              -->Newspapers quickly seized upon the selling power of this public curiosity, and many reporters were dispatched to the Fortress to interview her.<!--\n              -->\"Forgive me for asking, but might we know how you came to look the way you do?\"<!--\n              -->The reporters tactful approaches belied their urgency. Sigewinne, after giving the question some serious thought, began to tell a story woven from distant memories—<!--\n              -->In the times when humans and Melusines did not yet trust one another, only one little girl was willing to make friends with a Melusine. Later, when she fell seriously ill, Sigewinne was the only doctor who was able to make it on time. But because she was a Melusine — and only because of that — the girl's parents did not allow Sigewinne to enter.<!--\n              -->To save her friend, Sigewinne looked for a frightening witch and begged her to help. Having ascertained Sigewinne's resolve, the witch gave her a bottled potion of brewed sin. After using it, Sigewinne gained a human countenance, hands, and feet, and by so doing managed to save her friend.<!--\n              -->Having listened to this story, the reporters glanced at each other.<!--\n              -->\"Head Nurse, this is a fairy tale, isn't it?\"<!--\n              -->\"It's true, you know.\"<!--\n              -->They looked into the Melusine's eyes, then back at each other. Each of them was among the elite of their profession, and they all believed that they could see through an interviewee's lie with ease, yet there was no trace of falsehood in Sigewinne's expression.<!--\n              -->And so it was that they returned in vain, and perhaps there was consensus that the public would not be convinced by the story, for Sigewinne's answer was never published.<!--\n              -->Afterward, those around her came to believe that this was a matter she had no wish to discuss, and thus they privately agreed that no one was to ask her again. Perhaps only Sigewinne herself knows that she had hidden nothing, though she might not have understood the full truth at the time."

I received the medical items in a shipment a while back — thank you very much for selecting them and arranging for their arrival.\"<!--\n              -->\"Something quite interesting happened recently. A newly arrived youngster brought down an old bully who's been throwing his weight around for a long time now. He was injured in the process, though. He is very young indeed, but he's tougher than any adult I've met so far. He even refused anesthetics when I was stitching his wound, saying that he wanted to keep his head clear...<!--\n              -->Neuvillette's reply that time came a good while earlier than usual. He seemed to have recognized the young man Sigewinne had mentioned, and requested that she took close care of him. Although he wrote in the same officialese as usual, Sigewinne could sense that he was following this young man with interest.<!--\n              -->As such, matters concerning this young man would become a common feature of her letters to Neuvillette.<!--\n              -->\"Dear Monsieur Neuvillette, he has injured himself in a fight again, and refused anesthetics as always... I snuck some into his tea anyway, stitching him up after he fell asleep.

Our dear Iudex placed a spy by my side.\"<!--\n              -->\"Why do you say that? I only mentioned you in my letters because Monsieur Neuvillette was concerned about you.\"<!--\n              -->Wriothesley did not agree with this, but he did not refute it directly, instead choosing to talk about a certain encounter from before he went to prison. At that time, wracked with hunger, he had been flipping through a discarded newspaper, searching for some opportunity to make Mora. However, the one he had met was not the \"concerned\" Monsieur Neuvillette, but rather a warm-hearted Melusine officer. It was only thanks to the food she gave him that he managed to make it through at all.<!--\n              -->\"The Iudex does not... Or to be precise, he cannot show concern for anyone. This is one of the restrictions he must accept as the Iudex. Even his subordinates are freer than he is to show concern for others.<!--\n              -->\"Nonetheless, do continue writing to him about anything you like. I suppose that is one of the restrictions I must accept.\"<!--\n              -->Sigewinne, too, did not attempt to refute Wriothesley's view, even as he left — for she had never imagined that he, despite everything he knew, would come to such an incorrect conclusion. Long ago, when the Melusines had just come up to the surface world, many of them would present gifts to humanity as gestures of goodwill. Yet this was exploited by evil folk, bringing danger upon many Melusines. Thus it was that Neuvillette gathered them all, strictly prohibiting such behavior. If it were not for Neuvillette's express instructions, that Melusine officer would never have given Wriothesley any food herself.<!--\n              -->After much deliberation, Sigewinne decided to pen a new letter.<!--\n              -->\"Dear Monsieur Neuvillette, I have finally found a secret that even he does not know...\""

Many Melusines' understanding of humanity also stops here, for what they faced when they came onto land was human wariness and rejection; so they returned to the waters, giving up on further investigation into the transient lot that is humanity's.<!--\n              -->Unlike these Melusines, Sigewinne's curiosity bid her stay, and also alerted her to the magic of the science of \"medicine.\" It was said that this magic was quite marvelous, even able to change the natural law known as death by age and ailment.<!--\n              -->Sigewinne wished to master this magic, believing that it might help bridge the chasm between Melusines and humans, allowing the former to blend in with the latter. Unfortunately, in the days when Melusines had first entered society, none among the humans understood her thought process, and even less so were they willing to impart medical skills onto her.<!--\n              -->This persisted until a traveling doctor who the children called \"the witch\" encountered the Melusine, and heard her out.<!--\n              -->\"Seriously? What do you think medicine is? How childish.\"<!--\n              -->Sigewinne was expecting to be rejected even as she silently bore the criticism, only for the \"witch\" to scare off a few children who were looking to ridicule the Melusine, before waving for her to follow.<!--\n              -->\"Might as well come with me, then. I'll show you what the real answer is.\"<!--\n              -->Thus did Sigewinne come to own her very own medical kit, learning medicine at the feet of this \"witch.\" The latter was an excellent doctor and a dutiful teacher alike. There was almost no illness that she could not cure, no technique she could not teach.<!--\n              -->As their travels gradually took them all across Fontaine, Sigewinne had already learned how to prepare various medicines as well as scare off children with ghost stories, and she would also call this \"witch\" her \"Teacher.\"<!--\n              -->One day, this traveling doctor of a \"witch\" would stop her wandering feet, and with a serious expression that seemed somewhat out of character, called Sigewinne over to assist her.<!--\n              -->\"What shall we use to cure this person, Teacher?\"<!--\n              -->\"There is no cure. Just give them some painkillers.\"<!--\n              -->This was the first time Sigewinne had ever heard her teacher make such a pronouncement. Though shocked, she prepared the relevant substance nonetheless. Then, she watched as the suffering patient calmed down, said their farewells to their family members, before passing on peacefully.<!--\n              -->In the night, the two of them would continue their journey.<!--\n              -->\"I didn't know there were illnesses you could not cure, Teacher. Are there more of them?\"<!--\n              -->\"Oh, lots. No matter how advanced medicine becomes, there will always be incurable illnesses.\"<!--\n              -->\"Then why does medicine exist?\"<!--\n              -->\"All humans will die. In which case, why do humans exist?\" replied the \"witch.\"<!--\n              -->Hearing her Teacher's response, Sigewinne teetered on the edge of understanding. She thought back to the farewells they had seen earlier, rifling through her memories for an answer.<!--\n              -->\"For their smiles? Their tears?\"<!--\n              -->Her teacher, ever serious, suddenly gave her a rare, gentle smile.<!--\n              -->\"Let's leave it at that for now.

Afterward, he would ask those participating in his lottery to pick a box.<!--\n              -->Despite not managing to claim the grand prize during her first few attempts, after a few more tries, Layla began to notice a pattern.<!--\n              -->Though the stall owner possessed blinding hand speed, she realized that his left thumb barely moved during the shuffling process.<!--\n              -->Hence, she realized the box nearest to his left them would experience the least amount of deviations to its position.<!--\n              -->After achieving such comprehension, Layla managed to repeatedly win the grand prize. When the curious stall owner discovered how Layla used her insight to peer beyond the mirage of his speed, he found himself overcome with admiration for the girl and offered her a generous bonus reward.<!--\n              -->For Layla, the reward was a thing of secondary importance. The true pleasure she got was getting to behold the awesome skills that other people possessed.<!--\n              -->Unlike the conservatives in the Akademiya, she did not look down upon the arts and trades of those who worked in the streets. Instead, she was thankful to all the vendors of Port Ormos for the happy memories they granted her."

When faced with simple questions, she could calculate the answers in a blink of an eye without even needing to do the equations in written form.<!--\n              -->Before ever entering the halls of Akademiya, Layla had a chance encounter with her future mentor. Her mentor had complimented her then, stating that she was a child blessed by the stars with the thirst and capacity to seek true knowledge.<!--\n              -->It was these virtues that gave her the courage and hope to seek education and wisdom in the Akademiya.<!--\n              -->However, upon stepping foot into the Darshan, she found that her strengths were paltry when compared to her peers of a similar age.<!--\n              -->Only the best of the best could make it into the Darshans, and as such, Layla couldn't help but feel a bit overshadowed.<!--\n              -->As for shortcomings, Layla found them to be too many to count. For example, her habit of fixating on problems afflicted her with a great deal of indecisiveness.<!--\n              -->Moreover, her ability to socialize was also lacking. When involved in discussions, she often struck others as aloof and arrogant due to her reluctance in expressing her views, which led to her having few friends in the Darshan.<!--\n              -->What diminished her confidence even further was the fact that among the many papers she has submitted, few were actually written by her. Instead, they were byproducts of having \"The Stars' Blessing.\"<!--\n              -->From Layla's perspective, she is an insignificant individual.<!--\n              -->What she does not know is that her teachers and peers have an entirely different perspective of her.<!--\n              -->\"Hey, being mysterious and eccentric comes with being a genius.\"<!--\n              -->\"How does she draw her star charts so fast while we're doing in-field surveys? Are her eyes kameras? Wait, she's done with the stellar orbits as well?\"<!--\n              -->\"I have reviewed her papers and calculations and found the work to be rigorous and thorough. Her logic is ironclad. And some of her ideas are so intricate that I, even as an educator, am surprised. We have a fantastic student on our hands.\"<!--\n              -->Some people will always tread forward through life weighed down by their caution. Viewing themselves as lacking, they will nevertheless strive on despite the misgivings they have toward themselves.<!--\n              -->Perhaps it is also this perpetual dissatisfaction that spurs them onward, allowing them to surpass their fellows without even noticing."

Shame. Listlessness. Yearning. All these things weighed upon her psyche and exacted their toll. Eventually, her soul found itself in need of a small outlet. Something to give her some breathing room.<!--\n              -->While her body and mind are awake and aware, she is too chained by woes to be free. So, it is when she slumbers that her deeper desires come alive to inhabit her vessel instead, indulging in bursts of short-lived freedom, gorging herself on all the expressions and indulgences that she denied herself while awake.<!--\n              -->While sleepwalking, she is beyond the claws of self-doubt and depression, allowing her to easily overcome things like writing papers, drawing star charts, and making Starlogs. Matters that usually mire her in indecision and worry become simple, allowing her to pour out her innermost insights and challenge highly complex questions.<!--\n              -->This is the release of her long-held desires. But all dreams must come to an end. As her body wakes, she again returns to being the insecure, introverted girl that she was before. Indeed, after awakening, she can't even fathom that the wittily written papers and intricately calculated equations were created by her own hands.<!--\n              -->As she is determined and modest while conscious, so too is she sharp and smart while sleepwalking. Both sides belong to the same girl.<!--\n              -->Like a sapling in growth, she is torn between self-doubt and the desire to break free.

    "text": "Layla, being a person of easy temperament, rarely gets into arguments with others. One time, however, she broke the norm and found herself engaged in a heated debate.<!--\n              -->During a discussion for a class on Theoretical Astrology, an esteemed Herbad skimmed over Layla and her classmates' papers, and then began to harshly criticize some of Layla's arguments.<!--\n              -->In the opinion of the Herbad, Theoretical Astrology is a sacred field of study with laws and theories that have been long crystallized by the expertise of countless researchers across the ages and cemented irrefutably by generations of testing and calculations. For Layla to question and even dare to correct some of these pre-accepted notions was tantamount to blasphemy.<!--\n              -->Layla did not respond to the criticism in the heat of the moment, however. Instead, she listed her detailed arguments in a report after the seminar and submitted it to the Herbad.<!--\n              -->Not long after, the Herbad attached his refutation to Layla's report and returned it to her.<!--\n              -->By this point, most students would choose to accept the status quo. In one respect, failing to get a passing score for their seminar report will result in major negative effects on their finals.<!--\n              -->Furthermore, it was most presumptuous for a student to argue matters of academic validity with a Herbad, for any Herbad was far more refined than a mere student, whether it be in terms of knowledge and seniority, after all.<!--\n              -->Perhaps the arguments Layla made questioning long-accepted doctrine were simply results of a miscalculation on her part, and she might have been humiliated in the end on account of being mistaken.<!--\n              -->Even so, she did not give up. She continued her discourse with the Herbad using her reports. Then, with the passing of half a year, the Herbad went to find Layla once more. He admitted then that after consulting more researchers, he had discovered a point of non-acceptability in the long-accepted doctrines that had been left unexamined by the broader community.<!--\n              -->As he concluded his explanations, he told Layla with pride and emotion that the students who dared challenge him for the sake of knowledge have grown fewer by the year.<!--\n              -->The inception of education, for student or Herbad alike, is to seek knowledge in its purest form. Layla, in her persistence, had reminded him, at length, of this pursuit of enlightenment.<!--\n              -->After the conclusion of the seminars, as Layla was going through the bag that held the documents she had accrued during her exchanges with the Herbad, she spontaneously discovered a gleaming Vision in the bag's depths.<!--\n              -->It lay there upon a thick stack of notes, like a fallen star pressed into the pages."

And yet this must have been a person of some skill, for normal folk would not be able to delve this deep into the forest alone. Perhaps this person might even have some experience in dealing with machines in the forest.<!--\n              -->Following a brief moment of consideration, Faruzan concluded that this was a student of suitable age, fitting direction, and excellent quality — someone worth taking on as a disciple for sure. So decided, she revealed her presence from behind a tree.<!--\n              -->Having thought that there was no one about, Collei squeaked in surprise, the sound echoing through the woods.<!--\n              -->Tighnari was quick to the rescue, however, and following a stammering explanation from Collei (supplemented with interjections from Tighnari), this most major of misunderstandings was cleared up.<!--\n              -->With time, Faruzan would reacquaint herself with this young trainee Forest Ranger and get to know her better, even bringing her delicious food every time she visits Gandharva Ville.<!--\n              -->However, Collei has realized, to her consternation, that the resolution of the misunderstanding has only made Madam Faruzan... more eager to take her on as a student.<!--\n              -->Surely there must be lots of Akademiya students who \"respect their teachers and their teachings\" and \"devote themselves to diligence,\" no?<!--\n              -->Perhaps even Faruzan has not realized that there is one other thing about Collei that has attracted her attention:<!--\n              -->That despite having experienced inhuman suffering, she has nonetheless been able to gain the strength to face life."

Ayato is in charge of government affairs while Ayaka watches over the clan's internal and external affairs.\nAyaka is a kind-hearted girl with a pleasant temperament who treats others with politeness and courtesy. She holds the people of Inazuma dear to her heart and often goes out of her way to personally assist them in all kinds of matters. She is a perfectionist with an earnest personality. People are often moved by her dedication, and those close to her gave her the honorary title of Shirasagi Himegimi. People in the neighborhood always talk about her with sincere admiration.\nThanks to the influence of Ayaka's excellent upbringing, her heart is as pure as crystallized ice. Just like the splendid colors reflected as the ice crystals are spinning in the winter air, such is Ayaka's spirit. She not only possesses great outward beauty and elegant demeanor, but also, which isn't known to many, has a tender and cute side.\nBut if you want to capture a heart hanging high in the sky, you must have the ability to climb up the clouds. In other words, Ayaka is eager to associate with people capable of achieving great feats &mdash; in her eyes, friendships are dictated by fate, the same way she was destined to wield her frost-covered sword."

These three great clans are known throughout Inazuma.Kamisato Ayaka is the young lady of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, known far and wide as the Shirasagi Himegimi.When asked the whys and wherefores of such a nickname, many Inazumans have their own explanations...\"Lady Ayaka is as graceful and pure as an egret. And just look at her elegance, her clever yet proper speech — why should she not be named a Princess?\"\"Lady Ayaka may be of noble birth, but she is gentle and polite to us. She is kind, loyal, and is willing to help others. She even went against the opinions of others and took in that commoner, Thoma.\"There are as many opinions concerning this as there are people, but none can say where the \"Shirasagi Himegimi\" nickname actually originated.Still, Ayaka's popularity amongst the people is quite plain to see."

As such, the two siblings came to an accord.The elder brother, Ayato, preferring not to show his face too often, would busy himself with government affairs, while the act of maintaining the clan's image would be the responsibility of the elegant, socially-adroit younger sister, Ayaka.Through her dignified, demure and polite posture, Ayaka has very much secured a place for herself in the social arena. Whether she is negotiating with potential partners or dealing with difficult nobles, her actions are all well-founded and beyond reproach.The internal clan affairs are also in her care. Indeed, their estates may have descended into chaos already, if not for her."

    "text": "One autumn afternoon, Ayaka was on her way home from completing certain minor affairs when she happened to hear an old voice singing from within an old house.Within was an old woman, blind in both eyes, whose stick-thin fingers produced music like flowing water as they plucked at her instrument's strings.Perhaps it was due to her sharp ears, but the old lady heard Ayaka's footsteps and inquired as to who was outside. Not wishing to trouble the old lady, Ayaka replied that she was a nearby resident who had gotten lost and entered this place.As a member of the Yashiro Commission, Ayaka was well-acquainted with the peoples' lives and quickly recognized this solitary old lady as the very same person who busked in the city streets when the weather was good.The tune was outdated, and so was the song. As one who could not see, this lady had long fallen out of step with the times. Even in the nation that pursues eternity, some still endured such hard lives.Out of the goodness of her heart, Ayaka, thusly incognito, spent a long time chatting with the old lady. Taking Ayaka for an ordinary maiden, the old lady spoke of the method of making and playing the koto, and even gave her some tea leaves that she had kept stored up.Compared to the exquisite leaves that the Kamisato Clan had in stock, these rough leaves may as well have been grass, but Ayaka accepted them while profusely thanking her.That day, she thought of her parents many times. Had they been around, would they not have grown this old someday?Returning home, she spoke of her encounter with her brother, and the two siblings shared the rustic tea gifted to her by the old lady.Afterward, Ayaka would come to see that old lady again every few days, each time posing as a person living nearby, and each time bringing with her some daily necessities that were well-loved by the common folk.\"The sakura trees in the streets have bloomed again,\" Ayaka said to the old lady with a smile, \"and they are as lovely as your music.\""

    "text": "In people's imagination, the nobility's living expenses are orders of magnitude above the common folk. So for someone as noble as Kamisato Ayaka, surely she too must lead a life of wanton luxury.This statement is only half right, however.Ayaka does ostensibly live in a much more particular manner than the ordinary citizen.The costs of studying flower arrangement and tea ceremony, sampling fine teas, and enjoying exotic flowers daily are also by no means small. However, these are all skills that she must master as a young lady of a noble house — such commitments can hardly be called \"wanton.\"The things that can truly make Ayaka smile are, in fact, ordinary things that even the common folk can enjoy.The making of snacks, fishing for goldfish by the ponds, squirreling herself away to read the latest novels from Yae Publishing House... Each one of these is but a tiny matter.At such times, she is not the adored Shirasagi Himegimi, or Lady Ayaka, mistress of the great Kamisato estates. She is just \"Ayaka,\" an ordinary girl like any other.Here, she sets her dignified externalized persona aside and sets her true, casual self free. Only as \"Ayaka\" can she lay down her heavy burdens and do the things that ordinary girls can do.When hungry at night, she sneaks past the servants into the kitchen and makes herself some chazuke while humming a little tune. During tea ceremony classes, she might surreptitiously try to use the tea leaves to indulge in some romance-related astrology... The list of her little escapades goes on.Though she has never told anyone this, Ayaka treasures her time as an ordinary girl above all else, for these moments of freedom are things she rarely ever has."

To be able to teach such a pupil is a teacher's pride and joy.Still, Ayaka thinks quietly to herself, does she truly have no regrets?The essence of tea is peace and quiet.The heart of the sword is the keenest edge.The soul of chess is the wisdom to grasp the bigger picture.These three she has grasped indeed, and the spirit of true friendship also.And yet, Ayaka is still waiting for a friend to emerge who can walk alongside her on equal footing and stand by her side.That person cannot see her as a member of the Yashiro Commission, or as the Shirasagi Himegimi, nor will their conduct towards her be bound by decorum or status. And if possible, they might also be well-versed in a great many fields of study, and have witnessed all manner of interesting things... and perhaps they might even be able to tell her a story in a pinch.Only such a person might become Ayaka's bosom friend.\"Surely, this is not too much to ask...

Indeed, they would often join in the fun, tossing the Temari between them as a family.But that was a long time ago, and Ayaka no longer plays games of Temari.She has become an independent, powerful figure in her own right — and Moriwakamaru, the symbol of her childhood and the bearer of her precious memories, has also been stored away within Ayaka's cabinet."

    "text": "Some years ago, the Clan underwent a huge change, and a heavy burden fell upon Ayato's shoulders. At that time, Ayaka was not yet the mature and capable person she is now.She was originally a playful child, one who knew nothing of the clan's duties, and thus lacked the skill and experience needed for dealing with various kinds of people altogether.But seeing her mother on her sickbed and her brother hard at work, Ayaka sensed that she too had to grow up.So she decided to take up her long-disused sword arts and poetry, both staples of nobility. If she could master these two, she could at least pass for a decent lady of the Kamisato Clan, and thus help her brother show up at some festivals, alleviating his burden.Truth be told, Ayaka was not preternaturally gifted and would spend much time being troubled by her inability to memorize poetry, write elegantly, or brandish her sword.Yet she did not waver — a poem she failed to memorize once would be memorized fifty times, a poorly-written word would be written fifty times over, and a sword technique that failed would be swung fifty times more.\"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times.\" — This was something her mother told her.When her mother left this world, Ayaka was no longer \"Little Ayaka.\" She was now Kamisato Ayaka, the young lady of the Kamisato Clan, one of the Shogun's three great clans.Sword art training thus became part of her daily life and has remained so to this day without pause.On one particular day, Ayaka, at last, defeated an opponent in a single strike. In that instant, as she stood in the middle of the dojo, icy flowers condensed all about her. And there, upon the tip of her sword, now hung a Vision, icy and bright.\"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times\" indeed — and even the gods may thus be moved."

    "text": "Mika comes from a loving family. His mother works as an author writing about local conditions, his father is a retired Knight of Favonius, and his older brother Huffman is a current member in the Knights' ranks.<!--\n              -->When Mika began learning to read, his mother went inspiration-gathering abroad with his father accompanying her. During that time, the responsibility of looking after little Mika landed in Huffman's hands.<!--\n              -->However, Huffman had already made the Knights of Favonius his second home — he was preoccupied with work during the day and indulged in drinking with his friends night after night. With his own life lacking organization, how was he expected to take care of his little brother?<!--\n              -->So it was little Mika who learned to take care of both himself and his brother whenever he'd return home drunk at night. When other children his age were enjoying their childhood without a care, Mika had already learned to stick to an organized schedule, sometimes even helping Huffman with his everyday chores.<!--\n              -->While they were away, Mika's parents always made sure to send a letter back to Mondstadt every week to keep their children from worrying. Mika's mother, being an excellent writer, could somehow describe the scenery she's seen in a mesmerizing way akin to fairytales. Mika loved to read his parents' letters before looking for their exact location and marking out their travel route on a map. Picturing his parents' wonderful adventures was Mika's favorite pastime.<!--\n              -->Before long, Mika developed a passion for reading maps, and even committed the terrain of many locations to memory.<!--\n              -->Unfortunately, Huffman had to ruin the mood when he broke the bad news to Mika: \"I'm afraid your efforts have been wasted on the map Mom and Dad left us. It's very outdated, and it wasn't very accurately drawn in the first place.\" But that was to be expected. After all, those who with the ability freely explore the wilderness would likely have all become adventurers with nothing but commissions and Mora on their minds. To them, just about any map would do.<!--\n              -->On the other hand, most of those who knew how to draw decent maps were not skilled in combat, so it would be much too dangerous for them to survey the wilderness themselves. Not to mention their limited income, which wouldn't allow them to afford bodyguards. Perhaps the time would come when the Knights of Favonius finally had sufficient budget to hire experts to deal with matters like these, but with Mondstadt as peaceful as one could hope for, no one knew for sure when something as trivial as cartography could be put on the schedule. So little Mika thought to himself: If he could reach every corner of the world just like his parents, and record every detail of the terrain beneath his feet... That would be the most fun ever.<!--\n              -->From then on, Mika set a clear goal for himself.<!--\n              -->\"I'll become Mondstadt's expert cartographer.\""

As it happens, Ella Musk, whom he had gotten acquainted with while studying at the library, happened to be looking for a guide for a language exchange trip to the secluded wilderness.<!--\n              -->And that became Mika's first real expedition. Though they did safely arrive at their destination, due to an error in Ella Musk's word choice, the pair ended up getting beaten by the hilichurls.<!--\n              -->Mika concluded that this setback was due to his lack of combat prowess. \"I need to learn how to protect myself,\" he thought, \"or I won't be able to guarantee the success of my expeditions to unfamiliar areas.\"<!--\n              -->Thereafter, Mika rode the momentum from his time spent learning in the library and began to learn fighting techniques from his brother. Luckily, Mika had a strong constitution and quickly grasped the basics.<!--\n              -->It happened that the Knights of Favonius had just drafted their plan for an expedition set to depart three years later. They were still looking to recruit a few more members to fill some positions, and \"Front-Line Surveyor\" was among the open spots.<!--\n              -->This role had strict prerequisites: those applying for the position should have some level of expertise in cartography, and due to potentially dangerous conditions, they would be leading the team from the front lines, making combat skills a must.<!--\n              -->This was Mika's chance, but it all felt too much like a dream...<!--\n              -->Mika initially believed that he would be invited into the team as an external consultant, but the position of Front-Line Surveyor would no doubt make him a full-fledged member of the expedition — and one crucial to the entire team. He was daunted by the thought at first, afraid that he wasn't worthy of such an important role that according to him, \"only the strongest would qualify for.\"<!--\n              -->His doubts were soon dispelled by his father and brother's encouragement, and he remembers their words to this day:<!--\n              -->\"You don't have to ask too much of yourself. Doing your best to help will be more than enough.\"<!--\n              -->\"Most of the knights are just ordinary people like us, but once we put our strengths together as a team, even the strongest of adventurers would struggle to prove our equal.\"<!--\n              -->Thus, Mika seized the opportunity and signed up for the position.<!--\n              -->He felt reassured that he would, at least, be dedicating his time to what he loved."

Even though torches lit the area, Mika could see nothing but their eerily dark blue eyes that seemed to glow with an uncanny aura.<!--\n              -->At his teammate's reminder, Mika learned of their identity — the Fatui Harbinger known as \"The Captain\" and his direct, elite subordinates.<!--\n              -->As it turned out, their vanguard had bumped into Fatui scouts and an altercation had ensued, resulting in both sides getting jumpy and continuously requesting reinforcements, eventually alerting their respective commanders.<!--\n              -->The scent of gunpowder was thick in the air, the sense of crisis turned Mika's limbs numb and cold.<!--\n              -->He couldn't help visualizing the confrontation escalating into an armed conflict, and what he should do if such a thing were to happen...<!--\n              -->The Harbinger, in particular — Mika knew that he would be utterly helpless to parry a single half-hearted swipe from this person.<!--\n              -->His jumbled thoughts and exhaustion made it difficult to breathe or focus.<!--\n              -->Varka, however, seemed completely unfazed.

He is highly dangerous, and has the most piercing gaze you've ever seen.He enjoys a formidable reputation and high level of seniority among the adepti, but is relatively unknown in the mortal realm.This is inevitable.

If any mortal witnesses Xiao unleashing his true power, it is certain to be under the direst of circumstances — and they will be extremely lucky if they survive the ordeal.This is not because Xiao seeks to harm people.

As much as it pained him to do this, he was helpless to resist.Finally, on the battlefield of the Archon War, Morax, the Geo Archon,In Chinese, the phrase used here is {{Lang|mini=1|zh=岩之神|zh_rm=}}, which the English version usually translates as \"God of Geo.\" The term \"Geo Archon,\" meanwhile, is typically reserved for {{Lang|mini=1|zh=岩神|zh_rm=}}. There is no significant difference between the two phrases in Chinese (they directly translate as \"God of Rock\" and \"Rock God,\" respectively), but it lends to confusion in the English translation as the terms \"god\" and \"Archon\" are not completely interchangeable. had a fateful encounter with the yaksha's master.The current state of the world has already revealed the results of that battle.Rex Lapis liberated the yaksha and gave him the name \"Xiao.\" \"In the fables of another land, the name Xiao is that of a spirit who encountered great suffering and hardship.

The sight of Xiao, even far off in the distance, was intimidating enough to send people instantly running for their lives.That said... if ever someone did want to show some appreciation for Xiao, there is perhaps one thing they could try.There is a certain secret agent of the Qixing who is tasked with supporting Xiao in subduing demons. That secret agent runs a front organization called the Wangshu Inn.Occasionally, Xiao stops by the inn for a bowl of Almond Tofu, and if you could see the look on his face when he eats it... there's no mistaking it — he clearly loves the stuff.Nonetheless, it is not the sweet taste that Xiao hankers after.

Xiao relentlessly slaughtered the endless, impure manifestations of their vengeful souls, but in doing so, he caused them to fracture. Eventually, these fragments of their hatred were able to taint Xiao's own soul.The only way to eradicate such hatred is to accept the karmic debt it brings. The magnitude of the bad karma Xiao has accumulated over the years is enough to consume flesh, bone, and soul alike.And yet, Xiao does not feel any hatred. Having lived for over two thousand years, no single karmic debt constitutes anything more than a fleeting memory.No grudge can last a thousand years, nor is any debt so great that it cannot be paid off in this time.Xiao has spent many long years alone.But his battles have never been in vain.Because ultimately, the one with whom Xiao wrestles is himself."

He was merely leaving the battlefield.Long exhausted, Xiao felt the divine hatred that tainted his body take effect.Limitless hate flooded his senses, and he fell to the ground in agony.But it was also at that moment that the pain vanished without warning.This was not by Xiao's own strength, for he had been rescued by the sound of a flute.The clear, lovely sound of the flute came over the mountains and rivers, carried on the wind to where he lay.And clear it continued to ring till the first light of dawn brought with it the startled flight of distant birds.It protected Xiao, massaging his wild senses, and giving him a moment's peace.Who was playing this music?

As such, they wandered the land in a state of unending suffering.The chapter lists many methods of comforting the yaksha, such as food offerings, holy chants, and the like. These would appease the yaksha and help them to continue defending the peace.As noble warriors among adepti, the yaksha would often descend upon the battlefield in person. However, as conflicts grew over the millennia, they have almost been wiped out. Today, large statues of the yaksha subduing demons remain within Liyue's borders, but they have had their features destroyed.By the by, the language used in that text was so meandering, and its contents so dense, that it sold far fewer copies than the Teyvat Travel Guide and the international cultural summaries written by El Musk."

To humans, this would be an unforgettable event. But for him, this was just the beginning of his endless battle.The thing that Xiao truly cannot forget is something different.There are a great many human festivals, and few remember the stories behind them.The greater part of these days coincide with occasions where man-eating monsters were defeated by the adepti host. People imitated their deeds and staged exorcism rituals to remember their ancient heroism, with these practices eventually evolving into celebratory festivals.The hatred and residual might of many of the gods defeated by Morax throughout Liyue will sometimes erupt with abnormal force amid their half-awake, half-dreaming state. Among them, the eruption that takes place during the Lantern Rite is the most extreme in scale.Xiao has his mission to perform the time-honored \"Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering,\" and so he fights night and day during the Lantern Rite. Thus, he has come to hate it.Now, Xiao did not consider battle dangerous. It was due to his hard work that Liyue was kept safe. People lit their lanterns, and the blessed lights shone across the night sky and the nearshore.At that moment, another special feeling blossomed in Xiao's heart. Loneliness? Peace? Or was it his fears for the future? The young-seeming adeptus searched his heart, only to find no answers."

Over the millennia, each Tianquan has introduced amendments to the rules to ensure they are well aligned with current societal needs.The laws are compiled and published along with a 279-page commentary, and a copy is given to each citizen of Liyue.Ningguang likes it this way: Law and order is good for business, and she understands the intricacies of the laws that forge the order better than anyone else.However, there was a certain ship captain by the name of Beidou who acted with flagrant disregard for the rules, smuggling contraband goods by leveraging her exotic cargo and exclusive business intelligence. To Ningguang, captain Beidou was the black sheep of Liyue Harbor's business community.As Tianquan, it fell to Ningguang to impose heavy fines on Beidou each time she transgressed the rules. But much to her consternation, Beidou seemed to take these fines in her stride, like water off a duck's back.Outside of the official channels, too, Ningguang tried to find ways to implore Beidou to change her ways and stop putting the Qixing in such a difficult position. In response, Beidou simply explained away her actions as \"enacting justice,\" \"helping the poor\" and \"keeping the sailors in their jobs.\" As a firm believer in the principle of live and let live, Beidou had no time for Ningguang's advice.In the end, Ningguang agreed to disagree and gave up trying to convince the stubborn Beidou to change."

One rumor even has it that a wealthy businessman from the Court of Fontaine signed a major trade deal with Liyue Harbor for the sole reason that it would mean he could see Ningguang more often.Ningguang treats all her suitors with an equal measure of kindness and grace, but also keeps them at distance — enough to keep them interested but not push them away. Curiosity got the better of everyone in town, and now everyone wants to know: Who is Ningguang's lover? Little do they know, Ningguang has no love for finite things, and will certainly not be bound by something that is finite.The Jade Chamber, a floating palace above Liyue Harbor, belongs to Ningguang alone. It started out about the size of a room, but has since grown so large that in the moonlight it casts its shadow over the whole of Liyue.A portion of Ningguang's seemingly limitless wealth goes towards hiring skilled craftsmen to continue the expansion and refurbishment of the Jade Chamber, ensuring that it becomes ever more extravagant as time goes by.To Ningguang, the Jade Chamber is a symbol of her wealth and power, and a sign that her business is flourishing.Save for Mora, it is the thing Ningguang loves most in the world — because it is infinite.One day, she insists, it will cast its shadow over all the seven nations of Teyvat."

Victory in-game is decided by the number of counters in each player's hands.The rules can change at any time according to Ningguang's fancies, and when playing with others, she will always follow the newest rule set that she has on hand.When she's truly feeling the spirit, she will even design new rules on the spot — no one has yet beaten her at this game, and she has now reached the 32.6th edition of her rulebook.She marketed the 8th edition of the game to the general public, believing it to be the easiest to understand, but it proved to still be far too complicated for ordinary folk.Nonetheless, people flock to purchase sets on account of the beauty and intricacy of the model pieces.In truth, more people buy it for the models than for the game."

Unfortunately, they interrupted him not two minutes into the explanation before marking him down as \"unemployed.\"That designation is not exactly accurate, of course: other than the Gang's activities, which the Shogunate does not acknowledge, Itto does also do some odd jobs to stay solvent, usually working one day before taking three days off.As such, a more accurate designation should have been \"three-quarters unemployed.\""

If one really had to assign some sort of hazard level to him, then perhaps the level of being used by parents to keep naughty children in line (\"If you don't behave, Arataki Itto will come and snatch your snacks away!\" for example) might suffice.That said, unlike threats of \"the Great Mujina Youkai grabbing you and taking you deep into the mountains,\" or \"being inlaid upon the Shogun's statue,\" the scenario threatened here can actually occur.Still, \"snatching\" is, again, not accurate, for the fate of these snacks is decided fair and square by ritual combat!In the eyes of many, winning snacks off kids in competitions is exceedingly shameless, but Itto believes that every battle must be taken seriously, whether one's foe is a 5-year old child or the Almighty Shogun herself.It is also due to this conviction that Itto can lose to a child without any reservations at all.And while the adults have much to say about his behavior, the children find Itto the big oni to be a rather good playmate.He is knowledgeable about all manner of street games and plays them all with great gusto. He also stands up for any who are being bullied.Lately, the children have been very into Onikabuto battles against Itto.The rules of this game are simple and the fighting is both fierce and very watchable.

That day, Itto persisted even after having been knocked to the ground 7 times, ultimately causing the punks to back off in annoyance. Helping Akira up from the ground, Itto declared: \"Well, guess you're with the Arataki Gang now!\"Genta and Mamoru believe that the Gang was truly founded at the end of a certain year when they all squatted on the outskirts of Inazuma City and roasted Lavender Melons.That day, not one of them had a single Mora to their name, and they were all very hungry indeed. While gorging himself on a melon, Itto said with a sigh, \"We should roast Lavender Melons like this every year!\"That said, neither Genta nor Mamoru thinks that these experiences need much memorializing.For Kuki Shinobu, the Gang was officially formed the first time she had to drag Itto's sorry behind out of Shogunate {{wt|gaol|gaol|English}}, for this was the first time any official records had ever made mention of the Arataki Gang.As for Itto, he believes that the Arataki Gang existed from the first moment those words entered his mind.Unfortunately, he no longer remembers when that was.And as for Granny Oni, who has taken care of Itto since he was young, she believes that the Gang was never formed.To her, these children are just \"Itto and his friends.\""

However, because the oni bloodline has thinned out greatly over time, most people display only very minor allergic reactions.Unfortunately for Itto, his allergies are still pretty severe. Forget eating beans, so long as he makes skin contact with them, Itto will get itchy all over and even find it hard to breathe.This thus makes beans the only thing that the usually carefree Itto is particularly wary of in his daily life.For their part, the Arataki Gang members do not order any dishes made with beans, not even in private, as a mark of respect for him.Of all products made with beans, Itto fears Fried Tofu the most — indeed, he even says that the very sight of it leaves him feeling queasy for three days straight."

Then, he had gotten into an argument with a young tengu, the result of which was a sumo match in the Byakko Plain. Unexpectedly, the ensuing furor sent them both rolling down a mountain.In the end, it was the tengu who carried Itto, who could not walk after spraining his ankle, all the way home. Of course, the match went unsettled.Just his luck, Itto often thinks, that both such incidents had to do with tengu!Also, how on earth were these tengu all so strong despite looking so skinny?"

In that case, would it not be better to become the Blue Oni, whom people feared? Surely that was preferable to being like his parents, who were driven out despite having done nothing wrong.After his parents died of illness, the young Itto was turned out onto the streets, where he would lay into anyone who spoke ill of the oni race.Well, Itto was mostly the one getting laid into. But he proved quite the pain in the neck, never giving up no matter how many times they knocked him down.Still, he was only a child and eventually collapsed on the street due to exhaustion and hunger after a terrible round of beatings at the hands of some ruffians who had banded together against him.At this moment of crisis, Itto was saved by an old human woman.\"Why did you save me? Can't you see that I'm an oni?\" \"You must be hungry. Come, I've made some porridge.\"\"I told you, I'm an oni! Can't you see them horns?\" \"Oh, I can see them.

While roasting melons itself was certainly not an issue, eating only that to celebrate the new year certainly was.An Onikabuto festival was considered, but the year's end was not mating season, and so the contestants would not be half as motivated as they usually were.Ultimately, lots were drawn, and the \"Great Singalong\" was selected.This activity was suggested by Itto himself, and it entailed everyone standing on a cliff and singing against the ocean wind to express their innermost feelings and well-wishes for the future.The various gang members actually rejected this in their hearts when they found out about it. After all, screaming into the wind was nowhere near as fun as eating melons. Kuki Shinobu even indicated that she would like to take leave to return home on that day.However, the event went through nonetheless.

Now isn't this something?\"These were Itto's real thoughts as he first looked upon his Vision.That day, he would excitedly show his Vision to every person he met, even showing people where it had made an indentation on his back until everyone was thoroughly sick of hearing the story.A few days later, however, the story would change a little:\"Now as you know, I wasn't surprised at all when I first saw that Vision. I mean, you'd expect as much out of the first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang, after all!\"\"More importantly, a person's worth isn't something that can be determined by a mere Vision, oh no, sir!\"The keen-eyed, however, would notice that Itto had bought a very soft spectacle cloth.Also, a certain question showed up in the advice column of the \"That's Life\" magazine that went like this:\"Ms. Hina, how should I best take care of my Vision and make it shinier? And when I say 'shinier,' I mean shinier than everyone else's, of course!\"When gang members read this and excitedly showed the magazine to Itto, they were surprised to see the long-time fan of Ms. Hina just look at the mag casually before laying it aside."

She put the cabinet down on its back, took a plate out, and handed it to the child, reminding him not to have cold drinks immediately after having barbecue.

Then she would get back to whatever she had been doing beforehand.Of course, most people don't mind at all that she regularly goes the extra mile. But it can sometimes produce unexpected results...For example, a merchant from Snezhnaya once came to Mondstadt, ostensibly wishing to get into the winery business. In truth, he had an evil plot to ruin the land, destroy the winery business in Mondstadt altogether and then seize the market with wines from Snezhnaya.He disguised himself as an honest merchant with his family on a business trip to Mondstadt. Naturally, with them being visitors from afar, Noelle gave them a warm reception.Initially, the merchant was delighted with Noelle's hospitality; it was a cut above the crude etiquette he had come to expect from most peasants in Mondstadt. However, after a while he began to feel that something was amiss.Noelle seemed to be able to read his mind: She correctly guessed his schedule, cooked his family's favorite Snezhnayan dishes for them each day, and even knew that his daughter liked to go to bed hugging a ragdoll, presenting her with a hand-made doll she had sewn together herself.This spooked the merchant, and made him hesitant to execute the next phase of his plan. Noelle's warm smile now chilled the merchant to the bone. What else did she know, and what was she really planning?In the end, the merchant fled Mondstadt with his family.Noelle was upset for a few days, thinking she had somehow insulted her guests. Little did she know that all of Mondstadt was indebted to her for taking her job so seriously."

It was impossible to find a safe route to proceed, to say nothing of saving the adventurer amidst the snow.However, Noelle persisted on searching for the adventurer and eventually found him inside a cave, suffering from severe hypothermia.At the time, her coat was completely soaked, and the water inside her bottle had turned to ice. Thirsty and hungry, Noelle still managed to carry the adventurer down on her back.The adventurer was saved, but Noelle, having over-exerted herself, laid in bed for three days straight, suffering from a high fever. Everyone in the Knights of Favonius barely slept out of concern for her during that period. Fortunately, Noelle recovered.It was not the first or second time that something similar had happened, and everyone was deeply worried for Noelle.In order to prevent Noelle from putting herself in harm's way again, Jean had to invent some safe jobs to keep Noelle busy. If something were to happen, then Kaeya would have to save the day.During the Stormterror threat, Noelle was also eager to resolve the threat at its source.

Noelle made it over in the nick of time, lifting the full bookshelf with only one hand — and not a single book fell out between her hefting it and putting it down.There was another incident in which several cargo-bearing carts were attacked by Pyro Slimes as they tried to pass through Mondstadt's side gate. As the owners were all in a panic, it was Noelle again who came to the rescue — hurling the carts — cargo and all, into the Cider Lake, before leaping into the water herself and retrieving every last item.Rumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent Wagner — who prided himself in his forging skills — into despairing seclusion.In all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for Noelle, but all would lose their edge after a few uses.At first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: the swords just weren't strong enough.Putting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally made Noelle a sturdy and heavy claymore that was further reinforced by her affinity for Geo. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved.But don't worry, Noelle won't use her superhuman strength unless the situation calls for it, as she is a pacifist at heart.They say, however, that the very day Noelle received her custom-made claymore, she was set upon by a pair of drunken Treasure Hoarders in Drunkard Gorge, who thought her a harmless lamb...Let's just hope that no one else will ever be so unlucky."

During this time, Noelle, who always holds herself to a high standard, joins the volunteers in continuously cooking and serving food.It's not really any additional work; what's difficult is that she insists on tasting every dish to make sure they are up to standard.The crispy Moon Pies; the sizzling Mondstadt Pork Chops; the towering Pile 'Em Ups — all the fried and barbecued foods, equal parts delicious and fatty, are customary at the festival.The smiles on people's faces make Noelle truly happy. What makes her less so is seeing her bulging belly.

She remembered all the strong points of every official knight, but who would remember the hard work of a failure like her?She had never stopped aspiring to become a Knight of Favonius, but her exhausted body wouldn't let her get back on her feet like she normally would. She felt like someone who had spent days and nights traveling through an icy tundra.At that moment, the main gate of the Knights Headquarters were flung upon, and out walked Acting Grand Master Jean, who had just been in charge of the selection process.Without a thought, Noelle gave a precise knight's salute.Immediately, she knew that this was too abrupt a thing to do, and wondered what Jean might think of her.But just as she was wishing that there was some hole she might crawl into to flee, Jean stopped in her own tracks and returned the salute.After a moment's surprise, Noelle gave a strained smile, clumsy but pure.This was a lucky day that she would always remember, for she would receive recognition from two all-important sources this day: once from Jean, and the other from the gods.Her hard work had been remembered after all.From that day forward, Vision in hand, Noelle reaffirmed her belief that she would one day be able to don that armor.

As to other case details, she is neither curious nor inclined to ask further questions.<!--\n              -->The bodies, as well as severely damaged objects, have already been removed.

In the most infrequent of circumstances, of course, she will be invited to use this experience to aid the Maison in recreating crime scenes. But this is not one of those special cases. This case is already closed, and as a \"forensic cleaner,\" she needs only draw a line under it.<!--\n              -->And so she silently dons her protective clothing and goggles, and gets to work.

She loved the shiny bottles and the clear fluids within, basking in the mysterious reactions produced by interwoven aromas.<!--\n              -->It was due to her hobby of perfumery that she later became quite taken with traveling to gather materials.<!--\n              -->She has scaled snowy mountains few have traversed, and squeezed her way through the packed markets of other lands. Fragrances are shapeless, and are thus easily overlooked, but they are a necessary component of any person's living environment. Most people have somewhat unvaried preferences in this regard, but Emilie accepts all comers. Good, bad, simple, complex, Emilie carefully categorizes them all in her heart, and they form for her a bridge to understanding this world.<!--\n              -->From such a perspective, fragrances are no luxury, but rather, a thing that people can naturally enjoy... and thus, perfumes should be no different.<!--\n              -->Of course, this is very much against market trends. It is practically taken as a given that those crystalline, gem-like products should be placed under the searing spotlight and sold at extravagant prices.<!--\n              -->And Emilie remains but a hobbyist, and as such, cannot change this state of affairs by herself. Thus, many of her works have never reached the shelves of any shop.

She herself might detect a whiff of her childhood in the scent of Marcotte, but others might sense love, invigoration, and perhaps even regret. A person responds to things based on their experiences, and in such matters, one cannot generalize. If the perfumer does not take the fragrance development process seriously, but instead pursues the romantic color of some specific place and emotion, they will likely wind up with an undesirable result.<!--\n              -->\"And is that why you keep newspaper clippings? To collect the experiences of people?\" Chevreuse asked.<!--\n              -->\"Sort of,\" Emilie thought to herself. She had not taken those clippings specially for that purpose, of course. It was just part of her reading habits, being more interested as she was in real-life happenings than in the constructed narratives of novels.<!--\n              -->Of those various excerpts, the vast majority were serious reporting, while another small part could be compiled into a list of \"The Decade's Top Ten Incredulous Situations.\" These hilarious newspieces were fuel for casual conversation between Emilie and her friends.<!--\n              -->As for Chevreuse, she preferred novels.<!--\n              -->By this logic, it seemed that of the two of them, the Special Patrol Captain was the romantic. But though Chevreuse's great love was crime fiction, she was quite perplexed by the emotional entanglements of the characters therein, instead enjoying expounding at length upon how responsibility should be apportioned among the various parties.<!--\n              -->So, not the most romantic, either.<!--\n              -->And so, while their interests might differ, how they think actually has some similarities — a fact that goes some way to explaining why they became friends."

You didn't seem interested in my opinions, so I arranged to perform with a different troupe.\"<!--\n              -->The director was stunned. He had planned for Furina to discover the \"flaws\" in her view only after setup was complete.<!--\n              -->But he could already tell that the stage sections that had been constructed precisely in accordance with her directions were significantly superior. Ordinary audience members couldn't necessarily tell, of course, but to professionals, the difference was always in the details, and these were obvious at a glance.<!--\n              -->Still, this director was unwilling to simply turn back, criticizing Furina for not adhering to the spirit of contractual obligation by not informing them beforehand of her contingency arrangements.<!--\n              -->Furina would not let this villain cast the first stone, instead scrunching her face into an expression of disbelief.<!--\n              -->\"You don't really think I'm that much of a gullible fool, do you?

No matter how small, once it appeared, it would be irreversible.<!--\n              -->And the consequences of being exposed would be to reduce all her long years of work to dust, to allow Fontaine to fall — that was unconscionable!<!--\n              -->So she did her best to laugh loudly when she should be glad, and weep bitterly when she should grieve, and display the divine bearing of an Archon when it was time to show off, all without fail, all without rest.<!--\n              -->She knew that this was a performance.

Perhaps she had once been the sort to give up on herself at the first sign of difficulty, but such emotions had already slipped away, bit by bit.<!--\n              -->Those in the performance arts often say that one must become a character to play them.<!--\n              -->From that perspective, Furina's performance as the Hydro Archon has been flawless.

The affected areas were gradually rebuilt, and the people held high hopes for the future.<!--\n              -->Furina was the only one with no place in this new world. She was quick to pack her bags and leave the Palais Mermonia, nor did she return to the Opera Epiclese.<!--\n              -->She simply wanted to leave the memories that brought her so much pain as far behind as possible, and she was uninterested in the debates surrounding her — the Hydro Archon's tale was over, as it should be.<!--\n              -->But where should an actress who had finished her part and fulfilled her duty go? None could say, and the concept of \"freedom\" rang hollow.<!--\n              -->Furina's luggage remained piled up in her new rental apartment, and she lacked all will even to tidy up or get moved in. All she could do was lie in bed and stare at the bare ceiling.<!--\n              -->Those she knew had very quickly found their place in the new order.

Despite this, she was dragged, however reluctantly, into at least properly unpacking and tidying up the room.<!--\n              -->Clorinde then explained that she was here to invite Furina to a gathering. The duelist rarely took part in social events, but this gathering was one of old friends, who, as it happened, also knew Furina, and whom Clorinde had not seen in a while, anyway, so she thought she'd extend an invitation.<!--\n              -->In days past, Furina would certainly have refused, for the greater the intimacy of her association with others, the more difficult it would be to conceal her true identity.<!--\n              -->The duelist smiled as Furina guiltily lifted her eyes, having seemingly already guessed the latter's feelings as well as her old reasons for snubbing such events.<!--\n              -->\"I don't suppose you have any reason to refuse now, do you?\"<!--\n              -->\"Well... I'm not very good at this sort of thing, so, um... Don't you think I'd, you know, be a bit of a wet blanket?\"<!--\n              -->That night, Furina finally got to experience what it was like to revel and drink with friends. In truth, she was cautious at first but was restored to her normal self within two cups — indeed, so much so that at one point Clorinde had to restrain her from leaping onto the table.<!--\n              -->For someone as reticent as the duelist, the real Furina's explosiveness was quite the surprise.<!--\n              -->As for Furina, she still knew not where to go, but if nothing else, she now knew that \"freedom\" did not mean solitude."

    "text": "Furina once found a relatively unknown book in a library of Fontaine, and the story's main character was a servant working in an opulent mansion.<!--\n              -->The idealistic young Mademoiselle Crabaletta, following a newspaper advertisement, came to a remote manor in the mountains to apply for employment, and despite her clumsiness, became a maid there all the same.<!--\n              -->The Master of said mansion did not appear often, and though his loquacious surintendante and etiquette-minded gentilhomme managed it in his absence, she led a carefree life there.<!--\n              -->None of the manor's attendants had been to the city in quite a long while, and so the maid taught them to sing the latest songs, play the latest tabletop games, and thus the servants grew closer and enjoyed one another's company.<!--\n              -->There was but one ironclad rule, which was that none should approach the heavy wooden door that led three floors underground, behind which was locked a secret that only the Master of the mansion was privy to.<!--\n              -->Though the maid was curious, she treasured her vibrant life there too much to pry. Time passed quietly, and one day, they were told by the gentilhomme that the Master was about to visit, and so the servants hurriedly began to prepare.<!--\n              -->The banquet was akin to a festival, and laughter and cheer filled every corner of the mansion — at least, until the Master was late the second day, and upon investigating, the maid was to discover his already-cold corpse.<!--\n              -->The Gardes narrowed the suspects down to the servants, but the maid, convinced that the Master's death had something to do with the mansion's secret, at last decided to open that forbidden gate.<!--\n              -->To her surprise, what awaited her on the other side was the mansion's main hall, upon the central stairs of which stood the all-too-familiar surintendante of the house. The words she spoke, too, were bizarrely known to the maid.<!--\n              -->\"Ah, you must be our newest applicant. Crabaletta, I believe?\"<!--\n              -->Furina was quite dumbfounded when she read that, for the story here recalled similar events in her memories.<!--\n              -->She admired the happy lives of the maid and the other servants, and the maid's courage in facing down the ancient secret to defend that life.<!--\n              -->Later, Furina dreamt of that same mansion. In her dream, she was Crabaletta, huffing and puffing as she ran to that door of secrets, and, with one deep breath, pushed it open.<!--\n              -->Behind it was a torrent of seawater that drowned the mansion in an instant, dissolving all in its wake — the Gardes, the surintendante of the house, the gentilhomme, and even herself.<!--\n              -->Furina woke with a start, looking around her to gather her wits, and the rest of the story sprang to her mind, unbidden...<!--\n              -->Crabaletta made use of the time loop triggered by opening the door to solve the mystery of the Master's death and discover the mansion's secret, freeing all its inhabitants from an ancient curse.<!--\n              -->\"Thank you, Crabaletta.\"<!--\n              -->She thanked the brave, stalwart girl for giving that tale a happy ending.<!--\n              -->And as for several vivid figures from the story, they would eventually be given lovely forms, that they might be by Furina's side."

    "text": "Everyone has something to say about Xianyun: \"That tall woman with the updone hair,\" \"that bespectacled artisan,\" or perhaps \"that talkative new neighbor.\" They all say different things, but together they paint a picture of the impression she leaves — of someone who's witty, chatty, warm-hearted, and easy to get along with.\nBut that's not how Xianyun sees herself. In her own eyes, she's inarticulate, reserved, and unyieldingly proud. Aside from her mastery of mechanics and knack for making all kinds of little trinkets, it's an entirely different image from how others would describe her.\nSome curious individuals, seeing how her mannerisms and bearing set her apart from ordinary folk, are convinced that she's a heroine — so they go around trying to uncover her heroic backstory and whether she goes by any other names.\nAsk the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's consultant, and with a wave of his hand, he'd say: \"Xianyun? We're not well acquainted, but going by her name, she sounds like a good person.\"\nAsk Madame Ping from Yujing Terrace, and she'd nod and reply: \"Xian... Oh, Xianyun? We've crossed paths, yes... She's a good person, you know. Once you've met, you'll find that your days seem to go by much more smoothly.\"\nAsk Ganyu, and she'd nod too: \"She is a heroine, but a very discreet one — hence why she's living incognito in Liyue Harbor.\"\nAsk Shenhe, and she'd respond pensively: \"Xianyun... Of course, she's a master. Whatever you do, you must not offend her.\"\nAs it turns out, such speculations are not wrong. There's far more to Xianyun than meets the eye, but those who know the full story are few indeed. If someone was to address her as \"Cloud Retainer\"... Well, people would know her instantly, and you'd hear a torrent of praise flow her way: \"Who doesn't know Cloud Retainer? Noble, brave, loyal, and wise... A most worthy friend if ever there was one!\"\nSo try asking Xianyun herself then: \"Are you a heroine? Surely you're not... an adeptus?\"\nYou catch the new resident just as she's working on her latest invention, her pride and joy — what she calls an \"Exquisite Mini Broth Pot.\" She's too absorbed to take the question seriously, so she simply waves it off as a load of old nonsense and tells you not to bother her while she's busy.\nAs for what exactly an Exquisite Mini Broth Pot is... No one really knows, other than having been told that it brings out flavors much better than a regular soup pot. Likewise, none would know how profoundly it might impact Liyue Harbor's future gastronomic development. Suffice to say — if Xianyun says it'll be impressive, it'll be impressive alright."

    "text": "According to the \"Thrice Annotated Version of the Full Record of Pristine Pavilion,\" a roaming adeptus travels with the \"Spirit of Eight Pure and Mighty Rose-Clouds,\" dancing through the air as though \"riding light and striding lightning.\" Their lives, too, are long beyond mortal reckoning. What humans call a millennium is but time for a short rest for the adeptus in their abode. As the saying goes, \"Night and day belong not in paradise.\"<!--\n              -->As for where the adepti dwell, the \"Full Record of Pristine Pavilion\" asserts that the sky is their pillow and the earth their mat, and that they may dwell in the mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas — and this indeed seems to explain the countless adeptal encounters recorded in the annals of Liyue's history. This is one school of thought.<!--\n              -->Another can be found in the classic treatise on metal and stone, \"Void-Pacing Stone Catalog.\" While showering praise upon the weird and wonderful rock formations of Jueyun Karst, \"Stone Catalog\" also proffers a warning: \"The peaks of Jueyun tower up to lofty heights, striving to outdo one another... each belonging to a different master — Qingyun Peak to Moon Carver, Mt. Hulao to Mountain Shaper, Mt. Aocang to Cloud Retainer. The wise climb not a mastered mountain, nor quarry its rocks.\"<!--\n              -->Out of a similar veneration, descriptions of what the adepti actually look like are few and far between. Based on a handful of allusions to Cloud Retainer's appearance in the historian Zichang's \"Stone Tablet Compilations,\" as well as scattered references in ancient songs, we can know that the adepti are ever-changing in form. To take Cloud Retainer as an example, when in human form, she is said to be \"of elegant countenance, dressed in purpled robes and made up like a flower in full bloom\"; whereas in bestial form, she \"flies with grace, soaring among the clouds and crying out to the moon.\"<!--\n              -->Interestingly, one particular tale recounted in \"Full Record of Pristine Pavilion\" gives a further idea of the sublime character of the adepti. Once upon a time, a traveler happened upon Cloud Retainer while passing through Jueyun Karst. Taking out a self-made timepiece which he proudly dubbed a \"Jade Bottle Float-Type Water Clock,\" he sought to impress his ingenuity upon the adeptus. But to his surprise, she instead summarily pointed out the flaws of using a float-type water clock to record the passing of time. Hearing this, the traveler begged for her guidance, which he eventually received before being sent back down the mountain.<!--\n              -->Such tales are apt to make mortals lament — it is only after meeting an adeptus, free and unfettered by the material world, that one can truly realize how insignificant our lives are."

    "text": "Every second of every day, Liyue Harbor bustles with throngs of people coming and going. Local businessman weighed down by sacks of gold, outlanders garbed in strange attire, shrewd and canny public servants, warm-hearted guards... People from all walks of life with all sorts of personalities mingle, to the extent that no one looks out of place.<!--\n              -->When someone new suddenly appears in a city like this, people don't bat an eyelid.<!--\n              -->This particular newcomer to Liyue Harbor is a woman who goes by the name of Xianyun. Tall and slender, she wears a pair of red-rimmed spectacles and exudes an aura that makes her stand out from the crowd.<!--\n              -->To the Fontainian merchants who sell their mechanical creations on the streets of Liyue, she's already a familiar figure. When passing by, she invariably stops to discuss mechanical design with them — and once such discussions get started, entire afternoons fly by before anyone notices. She seems well acquainted with Chef Mao and Xiangling from Wanmin Restaurant as well, and is often to be seen sitting at a table opposite Guoba, waiting for a bowl of piping hot Dragon Beard Noodles. And she's also made an impression on the waiters of both Xinyue Kiosk and Liuli Pavilion, where she sometimes dines as the guest of Mr. Zhongli from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Granny Shan, the toy seller, remembers her too. If memory serves, she'd tell you, Xianyun's the one who often brings along a young woman with long, white hair to look at her kites and other trinkets. The young woman, whose name she now recalls is Shenhe, never seems to find anything that takes her fancy — yet Xianyun always brings her back nonetheless.<!--\n              -->Just like many other residents of Liyue Harbor, it seems that Xianyun not only has hobbies of her own, but also travels widely and has many friends.<!--\n              -->So when people see her chatting with Madame Ping by the fish pond nearby Yujing Terrace, they think nothing of it.<!--\n              -->\"I haven't seen much of Mountain Shaper lately. And Moon Carver still hasn't returned that Multi-Purpose Abode Cleaning Talisman I lent him, to this day...\"<!--\n              -->\"Is that so? What might that be then, some sort of new sigil contraption you've come up with?\"<!--\n              -->\"Yes, let me tell you all about it...\"<!--\n              -->Each day, there comes a time when the lights of thousands of homes finally go out, and Liyue Harbor falls silent for a brief while. With nothing more to see before morning, Xianyun takes this opportunity to take a stroll along the narrow path that winds up Mt. Tianheng.<!--\n              -->Jagged outcrops pose little obstacle for Xianyun. With a quick jump up and a gust of wind below, she's already at the top in the blink of an eye.<!--\n              -->Gazing down upon the murky streets far below, the human known as Xianyun transforms into a crane, and with a flap of her wings lifts herself up toward the firmament.<!--\n              -->But of course, there's really nothing strange about any of this. Liyue Harbor is a city that embraces all — so it's only natural that some adepti would end up living here too."

    "text": "Some of Liyue's history has simply been lost to the sands of time. The rest has either left its mark on the land in the form of ancient ruins, or — thanks to the painstaking efforts of those with adeptal affinity — made it into the annals of history. Aside from traveling to all corners of the land, those who would seek to understand Liyue's history must therefore look to the history books. Naturally, book collectors have played an important role in this process. One such individual is the great scholar of Liyue Harbor who refers to himself as \"Scholar Dongming.\"<!--\n              -->Dongming is closely acquainted with Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's consultant Mr. Zhongli, and indeed often entreats him to help assess the authenticity of ancient texts. On one such occasion, Zhongli had a matter at hand that prevented him from attending in person, so he sent a friend in his stead.<!--\n              -->This particular friend turned out to be a tall, slender woman who wore red-rimmed spectacles and introduced herself as Xianyun. At first, Dongming assumed that she would be a person of culture and learning just like Mr. Zhongli. But upon entering, she displayed no apparent interest in the ancient texts before her, and the only thing that seemed to catch her eyes was the old mechanical lock on the door. Overcome by nerves, Dongming was for a time at a complete loss for words. As if she could sense the awkward silence hanging on the air, Xianyun took charge and began to speak. To put Dongming's nerves at ease, she reassured him that her eyesight was perfectly adequate for judging the veracity of ancient texts, and then began to talk about her glasses.<!--\n              -->It turned out that there was nothing wrong with Xianyun's eyesight, and that she didn't even need glasses to see clearly. \"Glasses,\" she explained, \"not only help people see, but can be worn as accessories too, you know! And once you've realized that... Why limit yourself to the boring colors? What's wrong with red rims anyway?\"<!--\n              -->\"What an interesting person...\" thought Dongming to himself.<!--\n              -->\"Besides, don't glasses put people at ease? Don't they feel more... human?\" A sudden change of expression passed over Dongming's face when he heard this.<!--\n              -->\"I mean, more in line with the local fashion. I'm not from Liyue Harbor, after all.\"<!--\n              -->\"Ah, that explains it then...\" thought Dongming, who himself was not a local either. Hearing her say this made him feel that little bit closer to Xianyun — close enough, in fact, to steer the topic back to those ancient texts that he wanted her to assess.<!--\n              -->After looking through the texts for a moment, Xianyun frowned and exclaimed: \"'Shaped like a bull, with a winged tail'... Why on earth would Fujin of the North choose to take such a form? And the part about Mountain Shaper... it's all nonsense.\"<!--\n              -->One way to judge the authenticity of ancient writings is to examine their contents. Given that the expert before him believed the records to be erroneous, it seemed to Dongming that this book — which he had acquired for quite the pretty price — was most probably a forgery. Collecting ancient texts is an exhausting and expensive endeavor, and requires tightening your belt from time to time in order to make ends meet. Dongming couldn't help but smile bitterly as he reflected on the misfortunes he'd faced in life. His parents and wife had already passed away, and now these books were his only escape from the sorrows of living.<!--\n              -->With a voice overflowing with emotion, he sighed: \"Mortal lives are full of tribulation, while the adepti are unconstrained and carefree. I doubt I'll ever have the fortune to meet an adeptus.\"<!--\n              -->Gazing down through her spectacles, Xianyun looked upon the haggard-looking book-collector for a moment, before replying: \"It is said that in ancient times, people who sought the path of the adepti had to pass the trials of heaven and earth, and only then might they be granted the opportunity to prove their true intentions. The tortuous path to becoming an adeptus was no less painful than the agonies of mortal life.\"<!--\n              -->\"You're right... I've let myself get carried away.\"<!--\n              -->After a brief exchange, Dongming accompanied Xianyun back out of the library. Just before parting, she suddenly looked up as if she had recalled something, and said: \"Despite the fact that your book isn't genuine, if I were you, I'd consider taking that old lock on your door to an antique dealer. You might just find that it's worth at least as much as that book.\"<!--\n              -->\"And as for adeptal affinity... I wouldn't lose hope quite yet either. You have plenty of time ahead of you, so stay vital and look to the future.\""

    "text": "The prevailing school of historical thought holds the following to be true: \"Since the beginning have things existed, the heavens and earth bounded by their limits, as do the myriad rivers of the world — extending off into the four directions — all know a beginning and an end. Through the cosmos, the immortals came into being without waiting for the gods, acting without waiting for light and dark — moistening the woods and grass, soaking into metal and rock, their way of nature, their beginning unknown, their end unknowable.\" In simple terms — the world has its limits, and the adepti were not in fact created by the gods.<!--\n              -->Before the word \"Liyue\" even existed, the adepti already inhabited the mountains of this land. Among their number, some took it as their duty to protect the world and its people, while others were set on tyranny. Parts of this history have been recorded in \"Full Record of Pristine Pavilion\":<!--\n              -->\"The drought demon ran amok, setting the naked wilderness ablaze. The people's hearts were fumigated, driving them to the brink of despair. Beset by clouds of pestilence and miasma, they were gripped with worry. Who could they turn to? Who would save them?<!--\n              -->\"Upon arrival, the adeptus borrowed the wind to retain the clouds. Immediately, the clouds gathered together, and abundant rain burst forth from the heavens. Drought and plague were both driven away, and the people were saved.\"<!--\n              -->It was this adeptus, respectfully addressed as \"Cloud Retainer\" by later generations, that saved humanity from the demon of drought in their hour of need. Filled with gratitude, the people recorded her deed of great benevolence with these words.<!--\n              -->Later on, the great war broke out among the gods. The values and compassion of Morax, the God of Contracts, won him the favor of Cloud Retainer and the other adepti, and so they followed him into battle, campaigning widely across the land. Finally they prevailed, restoring peace to the land and prosperity for the people.<!--\n              -->Tales of that bygone era, with its heroes and adepti beyond number, have never failed to fascinate and impassion posterity. The towering figures of the adepti have imprinted themselves upon the very fabric of history, inspiring countless moving legends that have grown together with the people of Liyue. But when Xianyun hears humans tell their stories about the adepti, especially the parts about herself, she rarely seems to show excitement.<!--\n              -->Over the years, Jueyun Karst — which once echoed with the sound of joyful music — has become an unbearably lonely place to reside in. Nearly all her dear friends that once laughed by her side have perished in the raging fires of that war. Sometimes, the emptiness inside her is quite overwhelming. And though her companions sacrificed themselves willingly in defense of the world, she cannot help but lament their passing.<!--\n              -->But despite this, the ironclad pact that was made with Rex Lapis all those years past still holds her to her vows; the contract is a living testament to the united determination and aspirations of all the adeptal hosts. The thought of forswearing her oath and leaving has never once crossed Xianyun's mind. More than anything else, she values the ties of friendship that bind her to her companions — if it was just to uphold the wishes of her deceased adepti friends, she would never abandon Liyue at a time of need.<!--\n              -->With a mixture of regret and determination swirling through her heart, Xianyun's swelling thoughts gradually began to reside, and she listened in silence as the remainder of the human legend was told. When it was finally over, her response was simply:<!--\n              -->\"A compelling story indeed.\""

Wisdom must first be sought from external sources before insights are verified internally. One must refine oneself from the outside in, aligning inner thoughts with external realities to achieve a state of unity. The purpose of investigation is to explore the principles of all things, and thereby discover the universal truths that lie within. All that is in the world, sentient or not, embodies a set of principles — and only by researching and studying these principles can one understand the laws that all things obey. This is the way of true cultivation.<!--\n              -->The fruits borne by millennia of such devotion have been great indeed, and naturally it is this wisdom that sets her apart from mortal folk. That they live such short lives seems a great pity to her, for even if it was her desire to do so, she would not have the time to teach these beings the full extent of her wisdom in its purest form. Besides, those with more limited faculties often found it difficult to comprehend such profundity, even with her guidance.<!--\n              -->But after an intense bout of thinking, something occurred to her.<!--\n              -->Though mere mortals might have great difficulty apprehending the laws of nature through experience, she herself could invest truths into ingenious devices, and thus enlighten humankind through the medium of mechanics.<!--\n              -->Firstly, given that the laws of nature are profound and enigmatic, if she could dismantle them into a myriad of smaller principles and spread this knowledge through the world, perhaps this would help humans grasp them better.<!--\n              -->Secondly, basing production on the principles of mechanics would save an inestimable amount of manpower and resources.<!--\n              -->If machines could be used to wash clothes, people would no longer have to lie there in their beds listening to the sound of clothes being laundered in the dead of night.<!--\n              -->And if people could use machines to walk, there'd no longer be such a thing as a long, arduous journey.<!--\n              -->In the present day, peace prevailed throughout Liyue, and the land no longer relied on her to deliver it from drought by the blessing of a timely rain — nowadays, the people themselves could save their fields through irrigation. The fires of war were all but extinguished, and the people were content, now longing for prosperous lives.<!--\n              -->In an age like this, upholding contracts and protecting the world was no longer simply a matter of slaying monsters and exorcizing demons. Creating mechanisms to improve people's lives was another equally valid way to achieve the same end.<!--\n              -->A mortal's life is limited, and expecting them to fully grasp the laws of nature or devote their whole lives to building an enduring legacy was simply unrealistic.

As pure elemental beings, they are closer to the origin of ultimate truth than ordinary mortals.<!--\n              -->For Xianyun, channeling elemental power is something that can be done almost subconsciously. She requires the aid of no external focus to do so, let alone a Vision.<!--\n              -->But now that she's walking the mortal realm in human form, following human rules somehow seems oddly appropriate. To her, using a Vision as a medium to harness elemental power couldn't be easier... so why not?<!--\n              -->Xianyun certainly does not value the Vision that she wears on her arm in the same way that a mortal would. But carrying it with her led to a discovery.<!--\n              -->One time, as she was passing through Dihua Marsh, she came upon a farmer. Despite the fact that he was tall and carried a hoe, he was trembling and immobilized with fear in the face of a pair of short, feeble-looking bandits who were threatening him with daggers. Intending to help, Xianyun stepped forward — but seeing that she was a woman and slightly-built to boot, he tried to persuade her to stay out of it so she wouldn't get hurt.<!--\n              -->But when Xianyun turned to speak to him, he saw her Vision and immediately took her for a chivalrous hero instead. His tone and posture changed in the blink of an eye, and after bidding her join him in driving off the bandits, he charged straight at them. In the end, the hoe-brandishing farmer singlehandedly repelled the two thieves, with Xianyun merely knocking a dagger out of one of their hands. Yet looking at the shining Vision on her arm, the farmer kept exclaiming how much he wished he had one.<!--\n              -->Of course, the farmer didn't need a Vision — all he really needed was a little courage. But she saw the effect that the Vision had on him, and how his expression changed so completely it was almost as if he had become another person. The profound influence that an external object could exert upon a person became apparent in that instant.<!--\n              -->For a time, this left her feeling puzzled.<!--\n              -->Though it may be true that everything in this world possesses its own objective characteristics, but changing how you act towards a person because of an external object... surely that was folly in almost all cases. Known for her candor, she has always been easily moved to commend or scorn, but her judgment was always based on essence rather than appearance.<!--\n              -->When people are friendly to her, she treats them kindly back; but when they're vile, all she has for them is her contempt. This is how she is when she's Cloud Retainer, so it's how she'll be as the chivalrous hero Xianyun too.<!--\n              -->\"Open your eyes and take a look around — I didn't lift a finger.

Countless choices lay before them, but the mountain was silent.Leaderless and without any supplies, the unit was on its last legs. With their morale flagging, thoughts of surrender shrouded many minds.At this critical moment, Gorou stood up. He rejected negotiation and surrender, and instead proposed a bold plan.They would not hide any longer. Instead, he would lead the larger part of the platoon in a feigned attack to buy the others a chance to call for reinforcements. Once those reinforcements arrived, they could perform a pincer attack together.When asked what they should do if they failed, Gorou replied:\"If the enemy surrounds us any further, our options will be even more limited. The way I see it, we still have a chance, so we've got to give it all we've got.\"\"I'll take responsibility if the plan fails.\"After holding the line for several days without rest, the exhausted Gorou and his companions were finally relieved by a force led by Sangonomiya Kokomi herself.After that, he was promoted to serve as the captain of Gorgasia II, and from there he would work his way up to the rank of General."

Only by upholding this standard can Jean carry the mantle of the Gunnhildr Clan, whose motto is: \"For Mondstadt, as always.\"Some time ago, there was a joke commonly told in Mondstadt's taverns: A Gunnhildr learns to say \"For Mondstadt, as always\" before learning to say \"Mommy.\"As a child, Jean once lifted her head up from the book she was reading, \"Breeze Amidst the Forest - Ballad Selection,\" and saw the other children her age happily playing with pinwheels outside the window. The young Jean knew in that moment what her family motto meant to her.Now, when she lifts her head up from her piles of paperwork and sees the next generation of children doing the same thing, Acting Grand Master Jean has no regrets about her years of service to that motto.\"You have to give your all to do the right thing.

Her role and title within the Knights of Favonius do not affect her work ethic in the slightest.Her passion, honesty, and meticulousness come from two things.One is her education and training, which instilled in her a chivalrous spirit from a young age.The other is the devoted teachings of Varka, the free-spirited Knight of Boreas and Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, currently dispatched on a crusade.The effect the relaxed and unruly Knight of Boreas Varka has had on Jean's growth has been great.\"Grand Master, please take your job seriously. All of Mondstadt looks up to you.\"\"Well, you are my second-in-command, so helping me out is part of your job description. This way, I can focus on the really important things, wouldn't you agree?\"\"...\"He is the knight of new frontiers and legendary conquests, while she is the knight of maintaining peace and freedom.Jean does not resent Varka; perhaps there is wisdom in his conduct. However, what Varka leaves undone falls on her shoulders, and it is then down to her to do the right thing.Half a year ago, Varka led the elite knights of Favonius on yet another expedition away from Mondstadt.An expedition — how typical of Varka's character.\"I'll leave things here to you. I mean, you've basically been doing my job for years now, anyway.\"\"Leave it to me, Grand Master.\"After seeing the Grand Master off, Jean sat by the window and thought to herself:Upon your return, I will show you a kinder, more prosperous, and more peaceful Mondstadt."

Passed down through generations of knights, the title is bestowed upon only the most distinguished.On the day she received the title, Jean excused herself from the celebrations that followed the conferment ceremony. As if following in the footsteps of her childhood hero, she went and stood before the great tree.The title of Dandelion Knight symbolizes Vennessa's legacy of resistance and benevolence. So how, Jean thought, could one such as herself be worthy of this honorable title?More than a millennium had passed since Mondstadt's restoration. Did she really have what it would take to continue to protect this ancient and proud land of freedom?Beneath her outwardly mature visage lay the heart of a young girl, who had only just received the title and remained wholly unprepared for the task that lay before her.The wind blew from far away, and she felt it flow within her as it gently whisked away her doubts and worries, leaving her with an unwavering determination:For Mondstadt, as always.To become a warrior as kind and as determined as Vennessa, and to fight for her people and for freedom... Yes, this was the true meaning of her simple family motto.To this day, whenever Jean feels weary or feels herself beginning to waver, she comes and stands before this tree and lets the wind console her once more. It carries away her fatigue, so that she may once more have the strength to carry on.The great tree at Windrise marked the end of the first Lionfang Knight's journey.So too does it symbolize the beginning of Jean's."

    "text": "To Inazumans, fireworks symbolize summer.The various festivals that take place at fixed times feature a rotation of various events, with fireworks being the sole constant.Over a century ago, the Yashiro Commission once organized a dazzling fireworks display with \"commemoration\" as the theme.The fireworks then were made by the greatest pyrotechnicians in the land, and this was the origin of the Naganohara Fireworks Show.In latter days, fireworks would become more common, and the Naganohara Fireworks Show would slowly become an event in which all people would participate.During the Fireworks Show, everyone can light their favorite fireworks, and the owner of the Naganohara Fireworks store will pick an appropriate time to set up a most lavish performance.The year Yoimiya took over, her first fiesta was already jaw-droppingly good.On the night before that Fireworks Show, Kamisato Ayaka enjoined Yoimiya thusly: \"Her Excellency will be watching this fireworks display personally. As such, please add Her Excellency's emblem — the Electro Mitsudomoe — into the fireworks repertoire, if you would.\"\"Haha, just wait for it!\" Yoimiya replied, agreeing with great confidence.Before the show could begin, Yoimiya ran all about the city, placing thousands of launch tubes in every nook and cranny. At the festival's finale, the blazing fireworks formed a gigantic picture scroll that depicted the city of Inazuma in the skies.Yet Ayaka did not find the critical emblem in any one of these fireworks, and wondered if Yoimiya had made an error in her arrangements.It was only after speaking with Yoimiya that Ayaka discovered that the image of Inazuma in the skies had an \"angling\" trick added to it.If viewed from the Tenshukaku, the fireworks would form a huge, clear, and orderly image of the Raiden Shogun's house-crest — with some playfully lacy decorations on the side to boot.Of course, how could Yoimiya miss a beat at a fireworks performance? This way, she won the praise of both the people and the Raiden Shogun, and this feast would become a timeless classic deeply rooted in the memories of countless people.With Yoimiya around, the Inazuman summer shall not lack any glorious fireworks — thus was her nickname, \"Queen of the Summer Festival,\" coined."

    "text": "Naganohara's fireworks are loved by all, and work in the shop is always in full swing. As such, people often feel that coming up to the door without important matters might hinder the work.However, it's just the opposite with Yoimiya, for chatting is her other great hobby. In fact, if there's no one to talk to, she might actually find it hard to focus.If chatting with the guest is her way of \"understanding their mood and way of thinking, such that the best fireworks can be crafted,\" then going with the flow and sitting down for tea and an idle chat with them after delivering the goods is how Yoimiya rewards herself. Sometimes, if that is not enough, she will make some small-talk with her neighbors on the way, give them some small trinkets, and receive a basket of small treats in return...Yoimiya is always able to strike a balance between listening and speaking in such chats.She doesn't repeat herself, doesn't cross boundaries, doesn't come off as indifferent or overly invested. After a talk over tea, everyone leaves in a good mood.Her neighbors are all ordinary folk, and their lives are not exactly full of extraordinary things. Sometimes, the same news will be told by different people over and over, but Yoimiya does not find this upsetting.What she enjoys is the process of talking to others — even if they speak of the same matter, different people will have different viewpoints.After taking over the fireworks shop, Yoimiya's relationships with her neighbors became still more harmonious. Many old folks have taken her for an old acquaintance, and often invite her to their place to sit and recount the festivals of yesteryear. Middle-aged parents will ask Yoimiya to mediate the relationship between themselves and their children and will regale her with the little trivialities of daily family life. The young people treat Yoimiya as a sibling of sorts, volunteering to help her cart heavy fireworks-making materials around, hoping that Yoimiya will get off work faster and take the children out to play.Yoimiya puts it this way: \"I believe in the unique power of language. There's nothing that can't be talked through somehow!\""

But when the sun begins to rise, she will climb up to the heights to see the sunrise with a sense of accomplishment at having finished her work in her heart. Looking out at the hazy amber-gold clouds, Yoimiya often gains new inspiration, imagining all manners of new fireworks in her mind, even as sleep draws near...Her neighbors have often found her sleeping in places like eaves, tree branches, and stopped waterwheels. Sometimes, she even falls down, before blearily watching her sweet dreams and golden stars fade away into the distance.Fortunately, she has never been seriously injured in such incidents, but she has gotten a number of scrapes and cuts, and it was on that account that she learned how to deal with wounds.At some other times, Yoimiya will sleep until midnight, settling all matters with gusto before heading out for a stroll.Perhaps it may turn out to be an impromptu adventure, or perhaps a test of courage. If a friend is interested, she might call upon them. If she wishes to be alone, she will travel in solitude.Living as she pleases gives Yoimiya a sense of freedom. As for others, they may encounter her at any time at all. She enjoys this freedom, often saying that it has made her life very interesting indeed.Of course, she will restrain herself on the eve of celebrations.

    "text": "Apart from selling fireworks, Naganohara Fireworks also sells various intricate knickknacks. This can be said to be Yoimiya's second career.All manner of trinkets adorn the shelves, with some of them being exotic imports from Beidou that were modified and made into highly distinctive handicrafts, and others being practice works created during bursts of Yoimiya's explosive inspiration.From the Scatterbloom Marbles that will blossom when they knock against each other, Leaping Tops that chirp like birds as they spin, the Neon Dragonfly that changes hue as it ascends into the air, and the somewhat-failed Onikabuto Chariot... All these toys are inspired by the little games that the common people play.They are not only popular among the children, but are much-loved by adults as well. Even Arataki Itto, the head of the Arataki Gang, comes over to buy her specially-made knickknacks, which he then brings to go challenge the one he has declared his nemesis.Yoimiya's knickknacks are not just toys. With some thought, they can be very useful in one's daily life. The most classic example of this is the Katydid Coil, which is a ring that can contain a variety of flammables and spices. When ignited and hung up in the summer, it can be used to repel mosquitoes.Many people have come to ask Yoimiya for help on account of her excellent craftsmanship. And though she protests, saying, \"Hey now, this is a fireworks shop, not an everything shop. Even I can't possibly do it all,\" she will still try her best to help, even if her earnings for the whole day are only enough to buy a few snacks. She'll enjoy the whole thing, too — everyone in Hanamizaka is her friend, after all."

    "text": "\"The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show.\"This nameless folksong has been around for a long time now. In recent years, it was misconstrued by the children to mean that as long as they brought some shiny trinkets, they could exchange them with Yoimiya for fireworks that belong just to them, and that if they lit those fireworks up, their wish will come true at some point in the future.As such, the children of Hanamizaka set about searching for beautiful little trinkets with this song on their lips, before bringing them to Yoimiya, with expectation eagarly written on their faces.Yoimiya was quite troubled by this at first, but after hearing how the children had interpreted that song, she accepted their requests gladly and even added her own spin to the tale: the \"rainbows\" in the song not only refer to shiny treasures persay. As long as she found them \"sufficiently shiny,\" whether they were colored rocks from the creeks or shell fragments from the beaches, she would take them and make lovely fireworks as per the agreement.Indeed, if they were to bring her expensive things, she might, in turn, say that they are too ordinary, and take the child to look for the owner of those lost goods.But it really did not matter if the treasures were shiny or not. The important part was the conviction the children had that \"rainbows\" could indeed be exchanged for \"fireworks.\"Though some might take it for naivete, Yoimiya will give her all to protect the lovely wishes that only children can have.\"The things we believed in and experienced as children become irreplaceable treasures.\"The legendary picture books of Inazuma are often filled with the following images: the cute and playful Great Mujina Youkai, the majestic Shiba Warrior, the Origami Nue who appears out of nowhere...Perhaps those who drew demons in such cute forms also had a similar intention to Yoimiya.The children gather around Yoimiya, enjoying a gladsome time even amidst Inazuma's lockdown.Yoimiya's own child-like heart and liveliness never dulls, like fireworks and stars that shimmer and shine in the night sky."

If her friends or the children are around, she will share the sweets with them.Yoimiya's neighbors often mistake her hair ornaments for the candy box, hence its erroneous nickname \"Sweet Pearl.\"The speed at which the box lightens is taken for an important measure of happiness.The quicker it empties, the more pleased Yoimiya is.Sometimes, when things get busy, she sometimes absently uses the candy box as a hair accessory, realizing her mistake only after the day is done.Still, even this error would inspire Yoimiya. From then on, she would wear them interchangeably.\"Take a guess: does my hair ornament have candy in it today? Free pick of the sweets to anyone who gets it right!\""

It is only when the fireworks are ascending into the skies that she quiets down and just watches the lovely scenery.People often say that fireworks come and go in a fleeting heartbeat, but if they are memorable enough, they will remain in bloom forever in people's hearts.Those who accompanied you and the loveliness of the moment itself, will burrow deep into your mind as a beautiful memory.And as you look upon the same fireworks, many years later, that same memory and the feelings that came with it will surely rise again to the forefront of your heart.Is this not also \"Eternity\"?The special firework formula slips that belong solely to the Naganohara family exist for precisely this purpose.By incorporating goodwill and wishes into the gorgeous fireworks, ephemeral things are etched into eternity. This is the meaning of Yoimiya's line of work.On one summer night following her taking over Naganohara Fireworks, Yoimiya could not sleep, and thus she continued in her research till daylight came.Suddenly, she heard a tinkling sound, and a burning-red object fell into an unused launching tube.At first, Yoimiya used her Vision as a sort of lighter. Fortunately, her father discovered it and explained a Vision's significance to her.So, this tiny gem could grant a person astonishing and mysterious powers. And yet what else could it do other than protect the children or chase some mischievous monsters away?\"Even if it could have other uses,\" Yoimiya thought, \"it may not ever need to do these things in my hands. I'm just someone who pursues happiness, a fireworks-maker who enjoys living life.\"Time has flown since then, and Yoimiya has grown ever more skilled in the manipulation of \"fire,\" with her skill at making fireworks having likewise increased.Sometimes, she stops to ask herself this: \"How did someone as ordinary as me receive the acknowledgment of the gods?

He would be in a very happy mood when faced with a clean and tidy Yashiro Commission.Perhaps it's the sense of accomplishment that comes with cleaning. Whenever he has the chance, Thoma will pick up a broom or duster and sweep away any unsightly stains.In addition, he also takes special care of the daily lives of his colleagues around him.There was a winter when Inazuma's temperature suddenly dipped, and a guard of the Yashiro Commission accidentally caught a cold while out on patrol. A few days later, he unexpectedly received a sweater hand-knitted by Thoma.The sweater that was just the right size made the guard think back to the clothes he received from his mother every winter. Now that his mother was old, she hadn't sent him clothes for many years.With this in mind, the guard took a long leave of absence to visit his family. The day he came back, he brought Thoma a special souvenir from his hometown, and they became good friends."

Fortunately, he just drifted unconscious down the water until he got washed ashore on a beach in Inazuma.At that time, Thoma had nothing and no family with him, but still started his life in Inazuma with optimism.However, despite his best efforts, he was unable to find his father, who was supposed to be in Inazuma.But at his most difficult moment, Thoma met someone in Inazuma who was worthy of his \"loyalty\" to the end."

As soon as he sees it, he recalls those hard but happy times.At that time, Thoma had yet to comprehend various cleaning techniques. Due to his lack of experience, he was often busy doing all kinds of cleaning and tidying work until late at night.Accompanying him were the moonlight above his head, the chirping of insects in the summer night, and the sound of a duster tapping on the beams.There are many different kinds of cleaning. From a simple cleaning to an all-out deep cleaning, Thoma has experienced it all.At first, he found the work boring, but after he got used to it, he found that he could think more quietly when cleaning.So to this day, Thoma often uses this duster to perform his work.While brushing away the dust in front of him, he also brushed away the fog in his head in a quiet and steady state of mind."

Perhaps it would have been better to live a peaceful life.This calm mood disappeared the moment when he was swept into a strange country by the waves, across the ocean in a small boat.Here, he had to receive a favor to survive, and thus the thought of \"repayment\" arose.Ten years ago, when the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was losing its power.Kamisato Ayato, who was embroiled in the dispute over the succession rights of the clan due to the death of both parents, told Thoma:\"Now that the situation in Inazuma is unclear, the trouble the Kamisato Clan faces will only increase. You are someone who can see what's at stake, so if you don't want to get involved, leave early.\"Could Thoma, who had received so many favors from the Kamisato Clan, just leave like that? Choosing to leave would mean that he would have to return to his ordinary, stable life with regrets and guilt.The storm was imminent, and Thoma was like a leaf drifting in the sea.But after much deliberation, Thoma's answer was:\"If I leave at this time, I will lose my loyalty and righteousness. Father has always taught me to be a loyal and righteous man... I would like to do my best to do my part for the young master and the young lady. You will certainly need me as a helper in the path you embark on in the future.\"The will to burn for loyalty and righteousness forged a strong desire that drew the attention of the gods.As if to respond to Thoma's choice — on this night of divergent destinies, a Vision, bright red like a blaze, appeared beside him."

Long ago, when the Yashiro Commission fell on hard times, and when the Kamisato Clan was on the verge of crumbling, it was this young man who rose to the occasion and stabilized the situation.\nHe could not have achieved his position without extraordinary resourcefulness and cunning. But perhaps, that impenetrable smile belies darker waves.\nHowever, the most intriguing thing is that in most of these negotiations in which he participates, he is not ruthless nor competitive, and is even willing to share the benefits so that everyone can get a relatively satisfactory piece of the pie.\n\"What exactly is he up to?\" is usually what people are thinking after all is said and done.\nHowever, now that everyone has a piece of that pie, perhaps what is on Kamisato Ayato's mind isn't so important."

But as for the details, there's little that they can say for sure.Some people say that \"the Yashiro Commission's festivals and events are ever meticulous and have been full of consideration for the people. Surely the Commissioner's hand is in all such matters.\"But others also say \"ah, but there is much to politics that should never see the light of day.

Ayato went from being an elegant and refined princeling to \"the poor young master of the Kamisato Clan\" amongst the people, and \"that greenhorn\" amongst his political opponents.Time, however, would prove these people wrong.With extraordinary courage and some first-rate tactics, he did not leave the clan to languish. No, indeed, the Kamisato Clan's position would grow more stable than ever.The heavy workload, malicious deceptions, and attempts to frame him at every turn he parried away, even turning them to his own advantage.The passage of time has only increased the standing of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan in the Shogunate and with the people.Today, Ayato is a clan head that a great house like the Kamisato Clan would be proud of, and a Yashiro Commissioner acknowledged by all."

    "text": "The Yashiro Commission is in charge of ritual matters on Narukami Island, and must also attend to matters of cultural leisure in such a manner that deities and the people alike are pleased — and they do, honoring their commission.But with greater responsibilities come greater amounts of work.Fortunately, his sister Ayaka shares much of the clan's responsibilities, with most of the interactions between the Commission and the people falling to her, allowing Ayato to spend most of his time on matters of governance.Dealing with Shogunate officials is no easy matter. People come from different Commissions and clans, and their perspectives are very different. Any single task grows harder as the number of people involved grows.Ayato's great strength lies in his ability to handle such matters. The way he sees it, people are driven by interest. Find leverage, and the other side will cooperate.Find some goal that will bring the other party around to your logic, then pacify them with a few choice platitudes for the occasion, and most problems can be resolved.And when dealing with the stubborn, one merely needs to appeal to a higher power to bear — after all, what mortal could gainsay the light of heaven itself, no matter how high their status or arrogant their attitude?Over time, the knowledgeable and decorous Kamisato clan head gained quite the name for himself in the Shogunate.\"Hmm... this matter seems quite hard to handle. Should we ask the Yashiro Commissioner?\"So people would often say.However, while Ayato is indeed full of ways and means, he will not simply help at any given moment.Firstly, not every task is related to the Yashiro Commission. Secondly, it is simply not worth it for the Kamisato Clan to get itself involved for the sake of others' petty profit.Mostly, Ayato will simply tag along as a junior figure, teacup in hand, doing little more than smiling.\"Ah, come now, Sir Nagaoka. We are all loyal servants of the Almighty Shogun. Nothing more to it. We just need to be open with each other, and I'm sure we can resolve this issue together.\""

    "text": "Being limited by his station and work, Ayato does not often appear in public, nor does he have much time for any sort of leisurely walk. However, these obstacles cannot hinder him from learning of new and interesting things.Perhaps in the morning, he might spy one of the Yae Publishing House staff poking her head around the place, seemingly here to \"report for work.\" In which case, he may as well pretend not to notice, all the better to hear what new methods she has for skipping work... and then \"accidentally\" let slip his newfound knowledge to Guuji Yae.In a meeting with those old fogeys at Tenshukaku, there is no need to speak too quickly. After all, watching grown people argue till they are red in the face over petty issues is quite amusing.While walking through the streets, he might suddenly consider a certain unique snack stand. Going up to the owner, he'd ask if they are selling anything new, how business is going, buy a drink or two to try... and if he finds it interesting, he'll buy a few back for the rest of the household.Lately, he also lent some encouragement to the young oni who frequents Hanamizaka due to the latter's bug-fighting troubles — out of the goodness of his heart, of course. He also discovered that this crimson oni did not know what the name \"Ayato\" signified... which was fine, of course. No need to explain such things.On the way home, he might pass Chinju Forest and see passers-by having tricks played on them by the bake-danuki, in which case he will point the illusion out. If the bake-danuki should hone their changeling skills further on his account, why, they should thank him for the inspiration.And of course, even one so talented as Thoma might sometimes struggle to think of what to make for dinner. Such occasions are perfect for a hot pot game! After all, Ayaka always puts the most unexpected things into the pot — and how proud he is of his sister for that!Yes, these things are indeed the spice of the Yashiro Commissioner's life."

The ink on the inkstone is never really properly kept, and one might even sometimes find chess pieces or cards under the table.Each time the clan head gets off work, the servants always need some time to clean his study up.In the process, they discovered that assorted notes are often clipped between these pages. Upon closer inspection, they are written in different hands, and their content also varies.\"Clan Head, the servants have sent a new batch of flowers. I have placed them in a flower vase in a corner of the table. Please take care not to knock it over again.\"\"Clan Head, a shrine maiden from the Grand Narukami Shrine came over today, saying that the Lady Guuji wishes to see you. It seems important, as it involves the requisitioning of land in Ritou. She invites you to the Shrine to discuss the details.\"\"Lord Commissioner, the Momoyo flowers have not withered. The branches grow yet. Do not worry.\"\"Dear Brother, I learned a new recipe while attending festivities with the Traveler. Considering that {{MC|he|she|mc=1}} is from another land, do you think... that I might need to make some changes to said recipe?\"\"Clan Head, the servants have been reluctant to tell you this, so allow this old lady to say it. If you wish to eat something, please leave it to our housekeeper. Also, please refrain from using the ingredients in the kitchen... How could we make you cook for yourself, after all?\"Ayato's work often sees him leaving home early and returning late. As such, the people of the Kamisato Estate will communicate with him through these means.This was a method that Ayato came up with himself, and this is how the Kamisato household is run, via these small notes.Unfortunately, their use has seen the clan head's already messy table become messier still... Oh well, just a small sacrifice. Nothing worth writing home about."

    "text": "In Inazuma, people will sometimes pray to deities by offering certain kinds of cypress leaves.But as such rituals lack scale, they are often forgotten amidst the many, both large and small, that are conducted throughout the land.Though some time has passed, Ayato still remembers his mother mentioning that though these cypresses are evergreen, their leaves are not needle-like.Instead, they have large, crisp leaves that will not wither and fall even when new ones grow.As such, it is associated with the concept of \"prosperity,\" and was often used in ancient times as ritual plating for food offerings.Today, people no longer use leaves as mats upon which to spread food, but the habit of offering cypress leaves persists nonetheless.Perhaps it was just a hobby of hers, or perhaps she was just well-read in general, but whatever the case, his mother always had a great deal to say about festival affairs.\"Perhaps the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission were born to protect the deities.\"In his younger years, Ayato had not fully agreed with this statement.He believed that the Kamisato Clan was the Kamisato Clan, and that it belonged to the family's members. That was the reason for its existence, and any service to the gods was a job, a matter of circumstance.But such presumptuous words could never be said out loud, and in any case, Ayato could not bear to interrupt his mother when she looked so excited.No matter how long she would go on, Ayato would always sit in front of her and listen in silence, even if his legs might fall asleep in the process.With the passing of years, Ayato's days would be taken up by swordsmanship and books. The one giving the \"lessons\" was now his father, and the lesson content would turn from ritual affairs to matters that the clan's successor should be concerned with.His duty to the clan would be something that would occupy yet more space in Ayato's life. Nor was the Raiden Shogun just a mere symbol as she was in his childhood. Now, she was the Ogosho, the mighty defender of Inazuma's eternal peace.\"The Kamisato Clan stands today because of Narukami's mercy. As such, the Clan must defend the road to Eternity, and follow the Shogun eternally.\"\"This was our agreement, and it is the unchanging rule of our clan. Remember this well.\"As for the specifics of what happened, Ayato had already gleaned some of them from reading their ancestral teachings. It was the Kamisato elders' failings that had resulted in the nationally-important Raiden Gokaden to suffer great loss. If not for Guuji Yae's intervention on their behalf, causing the Shogun to show them mercy, the Kamisato Clan may have joined others in falling from grace and ceasing to exist.This was the grace of Her Excellency, and at the same time, it was a warning from Her servant.As such, Ayato never snubbed his father's teachings. Though he still believed in protecting his clan above all else, he also understood that Inazuma was sustained by the Electro Archon's protection. Only peace in Inazuma could guarantee the longevity and prosperity of the clan.No matter how things might change in Inazuma, the Kamisato Clan alone would never betray the Almighty Narukami.Even if his heart said differently, he could only bury it deep beneath well-maintained appearances.Just as his mother said back then—\"The divinely-protected cypress will sprout new leaves from ancient branches.So, too, can the camellia in the courtyard remain fragrant even in the most bitter winter.\""

    "text": "Even Kamisato Ayato himself could not have expected that calligraphy practice, which he had found most boring in his youth, would eventually become a favored pastime of his.He had slogged through much penmanship practice to better play the part of the Kamisato Clan's eldest son.But nowadays, he transcribes a few poems from time to time to clear his mind and think in silence.Of course, this also lets him seem like he is busy with official business even while idle, all the better to avoid seeing some people and doing certain things.With time's passing, it became agreed among the servants waiting on him that he not only liked to play chess but was also fond of calligraphy.Such talk would spread widely via word of mouth. As such, Ayato often receives excellent brushes as gifts during festivals or birthdays.Some of the more speculative have even bought him exquisite and expensive quill pens from overseas.Ayato has never attempted to clarify this matter, but instead had a lovely wooden case made in which he stores such stationery.He has always been interested in all things new, and trying out these new pens is indeed fun.Moreover, these gifts often say much about the person who sent them. Such information thus becomes one of the means by which Ayato can get a handle on them.That said, though he claims to have bought this case to store stationery, there are three pens that Ayato has never placed inside it.One of them, slim and well-crafted, is placed on his desk. It shows signs of some wear and tear, but it writes well, and is used for writing petitions.The second is stored in a drawer at the bottom, its fine tip having seen much loving use in the past when Ayato was practicing calligraphy. Its beginner-friendly nature also saw it borrowed quite often by Thoma and Ayaka back in the day.As for the third, it is stored deep within a wooden cabinet used to store antiques, sealed within a silk bag. Excellent of make and design, it was presented to him by his mother during his adulthood ceremony."

    "text": "One night, many years ago, Ayato's gravely-ill father summoned him into his presence.That night, his father seemed a little different from the illness-weathered figure he had become. His expression was solemn, and yet the concern in his eyes was all too clear.Forcing himself to stay alert, he asked Ayato: was his training done? Had he eaten enough for dinner? How was his swordsmanship progressing?As Ayato replied, his father nodded with a smile, seemingly satisfied. Yet, his expression would quickly darken, as if there was something he wanted to, but could not say.After much hesitation, and under his wife's melancholic gaze, his father would finally speak, his voice heavy:\"Ayato... Remember, no matter what happens to the Kamisato Clan in the future, you are our eldest son, Ayaka's elder brother... A successor the Kamisato Clan is proud to have.\"After reminding his father to rest well, Ayato would take leave of his parents and return to his bedroom.The moment he opened the door, he saw the shining Vision lying on his desk.Ayato had heard since he was young that Visions are signs of the gods' favor, born of human wishes.Since his youth, he had longed to become the family's pillar, not for any great work, but to ensure that the clan would prosper, and to protect them.That this Vision should appear now... meant that, perhaps, the time had come for him to take up this burden.So thinking, Ayato did not call for the servants to light the lamps. Instead, he merely sat down beside the table.Many things flowed through his mind then like a tide:His father was gravely ill, and his mother was also unwell. The clan was leaderless, and its competitors eyed its position and power hungrily, as they had for some time now.His sister was still young, and he had to ensure that she grew up safely. The Shogunate courts were like a sea full of hidden reefs. One had to tread most carefully there...They could not let go of the Shuumatsuban, command over which had passed down through the family for generations. As for the servants, some few might still be trusted should the Kamisato Clan's strength wane...And as for Thoma, who had come from a different land, though he was a friend and useful ally both, would he consider other options should the Kamisato Clan truly fall?These scattered thoughts would gradually straighten themselves out in Ayato's mind, and at their center was his still-unchanged conviction—He would use any means at his disposal to secure the safety of his family and its future. Obstacles to that goal would be cleared away, no matter the cost.That night, the Vision was the only light that accompanied him.And when the first light of the next dawn alighted upon the desk, the young heir was already prepared to face the world."

    "text": "\"Shamans\" are practitioners of a mysterious craft who originate from the Masters of the Night-Wind. With many mystical abilities at their disposal, they are wise and powerful figures. In the eyes of the people of Natlan, whether one seeks medicine or wishes to decipher a cryptic prophecy, visiting a shaman is always the right choice. They can be both doctors and prophets, playing indispensable roles both in everyday life and in matters of far greater import. In short, theirs is a highly respected profession.\nYet above the many shamans, there are \"great shamans\" in a league of their own. They say it is a title that only those who reach the very pinnacle of their mystical arts may earn — and indeed, throughout the entire history of Natlan, they have been few and far between. Their deeds shine forth like the brightest stars in the night sky, adding a touch of legend to the already unfathomable shamanistic mystique.\nCitlali is one such great shaman, and the only one in Natlan today.\nYet contrary to what most might expect, you will not find her dealing with everyday matters, nor with major affairs, rarely even participating in events as significant as tribal ceremonies. For outsiders who seek the great shaman's assistance, navigating the many obstacles in their way may prove a greater challenge than traversing the many chasms of Natlan itself.\n\"Looking for Granny Itztli? Best not disturb her! If you really must go, go prepared — and just so we're on the same page, don't go dragging me into it...\" Thus would most members of the Masters of the Night Wind respond, as if Citlali were some formidable fiend, a monster of great menace and untold might.\n\"The great shaman... Mwahaha, she's your only option, isn't she? Pfff, the Almighty Dragonlord doesn't have time for puny punks like you. But since you asked so nicely, I'll let you use my name when you knock. That way, she's bound to take your request seriously.\" A certain oddball entity and self-styled Dragonlord might respond as such, as if Citlali were some easily dealt with triviality.\n\"Need Granny's help? You're looking for the right person if so — she knows everything about everything! Do you have her address? Actually, let me take you there myself! Oh, just so you know, when we get there, you'll have to keep knocking non-stop. Granny's kinda shy, so you have to be proactive, alright?\" This is the kind of response you'd receive from a certain top-ranking guide from the People of the Springs, as if Citlali were no more than a bashful young girl.\n\"Seeking help from Citlali? A wise choice indeed. Her assistance has been instrumental in the success of many of Natlan's most important affairs. I'm confident she'll know how to resolve your troubles too.\" That great leader, the keeper of the Sacred Flame herself, might say this, as if Citlali were the very epitome of a responsible and approachable elder.\nUltimately, after much inquiry, those seeking her aid often end up feeling even more confused than when they first set out, left with no other choice but to give up their petition as a lost cause."

    "text": "Citlali's home lies at some considerable distance from the tribal settlement. Tucked away in a secluded corner of the mountains, you might call it the perfect retreat for solitary living. But in stark contrast to the way the homes of the average \"recluse\" might blend into their natural surroundings, her remote dwelling is conspicuous — so much so, in fact, that it is practically unmissable.\nThe main reason for this, no doubt, is the graffiti that covers its outer walls. Bold, over-the-top, and provocative, it seems to have been deliberately designed to get on someone's nerves. To understand this, one must note a rather odd tradition that has become prevalent among the Masters of the Night-Wind's shamans. They will often strive to seek out particularly strong peers among their circle, then orchestrate coincidences by which their own students end up clashing with these powerful shamans; and then, by utilizing the pressure exerted by these formidable figures, they push their students to improve. Perhaps it is precisely because of the familial character of the bond between master and disciple shamans that, to bypass their own subconscious, almost parental tenderness, they must rely upon a stern uncle or aunt figure to carry out the tough tests required. Many years ago, another great shaman named Huitzilin chose Citlali to be the target of such conflicts for her own students. How did she achieve this, you might ask? By having them plaster the outer walls of Citlali's home with taunting graffiti — a direct and unignorable challenge if ever there was one.\nFor her part, Citlali performed her role of encouraging the younger generation to improve with flying colors. Not a single one of those bumptious, presumptuous, self-important novices — puffed up by having a great shaman as their mentor — withstood more than a single meeting with her as their adversary. They were, to the last, left humbled and respectful, viewing shamanhood with newfound reverence.\nAfter Huitzilin's passing, her disciples, and even the disciples of her disciples, continued to designate Citlali as the target for their students to challenge, claiming that this was her dying wish.\nThough this practice strayed somewhat from tradition, most Masters of the Night-Wind were unsurprised. Huitzilin had been a great shaman on par with Citlali, and was said to understand and admire Citlali's strength better than anyone. To Huitzilin, only those bold enough to challenge Citlali were worthy of inheriting her legacy. And indeed, the challenges yielded remarkable results. Those brave enough to face Citlali often went on to make exceptional achievements, whether holding key positions within the tribe or attaining a profound mastery of the mystic arts. Over time, challenging Citlali through the medium of graffiti became a tradition of its own.\nThis tradition, though, has been the source of no small amount of grief for Huitzilin's own shamanic descendants. Starting right from their days as apprentices, they must endure defeat after crushing defeat at Citlali's hands. Eventually, they had no choice but to modify Huitzilin's challenge criteria, making it enough to simply last long enough against her. All manner of stories began to spread about Granny Itztli, fueled by the sorry experiences of all those challengers who fell short.\nWhenever a challenger fails, Citlali uses her mystical abilities to erase their graffiti. Thus, over the years, the graffiti on the wall has changed, time and time again. As time went on, Citlali's initial irritation dulled. Given her power and status, she could easily have put an end to this annoying practice, yet instead she allowed it to continue. As for her reasons, some would argue that Citlali uses these failed challengers as a means of enhancing her own reputation; while others believe that, despite her general aloofness, the great shaman still retains a sense of responsibility for nurturing future generations. Even if just a sliver...\nPerhaps only Citlali herself knows the real reason — that it reminds her of that precious time spent sparring with an old rival. As long as that ever-changing graffiti continues to appear on her wall, she can keep pretending that those days never truly passed."

    "text": "If you were to ask someone what Citlali's favorite hobby was, no matter if they knew her well, feared her, or even just heard a rumor about her for the very first time, you would get the same answer: light novels. Almost everyone's first encounter with her involves seeing her engrossed in one of these books.\nBut if you were then to follow up and ask which light novel was her favorite... Well, that's something even those who know her best would struggle to agree upon.\nSome are convinced that it is \"Mirage Warriors,\" the light novel she most frequently discusses, and perhaps the first one she ever read. Rumor has it that this early classic switched authors three times, yet despite this, was never actually brought to completion. Most of its original readers have, in fact, already passed away — the last one left being Citlali herself, still alive and holding out for updates after two full centuries. Such a book, they say, must hold a special meaning in the context of Citlali's long life, making it the strongest contender for her favorite.\nOthers claim it must be the popular favorite \"A Legend of Sword,\" widely known even throughout Natlan. Yet when others bring up this work, Citlali often seems displeased — not because of any issue with the story itself, but because of her lingering resentment over that one time when they decided not to hold a signing event in Natlan.\nThen there are the heated debates between the advocates of \"Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power\" and \"Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?.\" One school of thought believes the former is her favorite, pointing to the time that she discovered her copy of \"Raiden Reincarnation\" was not actually a first edition, flying into such a rage that she nearly scared the book merchant to death. The other side argues for the latter, recounting how ruthlessly Citlali crushed a certain group of challengers whose sudden appearance had caused her to miss out on getting her hands on the deluxe edition of \"Kitsune Guuji.\"\nCitlali herself has never given a straightforward answer to the question, leaving the matter unresolved. However, a particularly bold specimen of a prying busybody once claimed to have discovered a secret compartment in her bookshelf, well-concealed and even protected by several layers of special mystical seals — without a shadow of a doubt, the ironclad repository of her most treasured light novel.\nCitlali quickly deduced that this individual must have been a petty thief who had once broken into her home. After tracking down the intruder and personally administering a thorough thrashing, she handed them over to the tribal guards. From that moment on, the mystical defenses around her home gained yet another layer of protection.\nStill, she never outright denied the pesky little pilferer's claim. Because, as it just so happens, there is indeed a secret compartment in her bookshelf.\nThe book stored within is neither one of the latest bestsellers nor a rare out-of-print collector's edition. Instead, it is an obscure and unsung light novel, barely known even in its homeland of Inazuma: \"New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune.\"\nSo, is this Citlali's favorite light novel? It's very hard to say. Perhaps, just perhaps, her reason for storing it there had something to do with the first sentence she read when she opened it.\n\"Stories relating to memory always seem to have to do with those moments where you gain something and lose it straight away.\""

    "text": "Whenever Citlali's friends make plans to celebrate her birthday, they always run up against a rather tricky question — just how old is she, actually?\nJudging from her appearance... There's no way to tell.\nAccording to Citlali's own oft-repeated claim, the answer seems to be 200. However, some elders of the Masters of the {{sic|Night Wind|expected=Night-Wind}} insist that she must be older, for she has an intimate knowledge of many things that happened over two centuries ago.\n\"D'you think Granny was adopted by Saurians when she was young too?\" Chasca would wonder, drawing a parallel with her own childhood experience of being raised by a Qucusaur and losing track of her real age.\n\"Granny'll always be Granny, and that's not gonna change — whether she's 200 or more.\" Ororon would respond when people came asking. Having been raised by Citlali since childhood, his awareness of her \"ageless\" aura is perhaps keener than any other's.\nBut Xilonen was never satisfied with that answer. After all, if they were planning to order a personalized birthday cake, a vague number would only confuse the baker. In her view, clarifying your requirements is the most basic courtesy a customer owes.\n\"Hah! If a mere two hundred years has you all running around like headless Flowcurrent Birds, imagine if you could comprehend the unfathomable antiquity of this Almighty Dragonl—\" Before he could finish, Ajaw's comments were cut short by Kinich, whose lightning-fast elbow sent the little party pooper flying.\n\"Why don't we just settle for 200? Seeing as Granny always insists that's how old she is, I'm sure she has her reasons — just like how many people say they're 'forever 18.' It's a way of making themselves seem younger!\" Despite leaving them all deep in thought for a while, Mualani's suggestion was collectively rejected in the end. No matter how you spin it, \"forever 200\" is an absurd way of projecting a youthful image.\nWhen all others had given up, the ever-resourceful Iansan called upon Mavuika, hoping that the memories passed down by the Sacred Flame might offer some clues. But even Mavuika could not provide a definitive answer. So far as past Pyro Archons remembered, Citlali had always lived the life of a recluse, leaving no indication of her exact age.\nAnd so, they continued to hesitate, knowing that asking Citlali directly was simply out of the question. The quick-witted great shaman would see right through them, completely ruining their celebratory surprise in an instant.\nIn the end, they decided to sidestep the issue altogether, settling on a cake design that didn't require her age to be displayed.\nOn the evening of her birthday, they lured Citlali out of her home with a knock at the door, unveiling the cake and an array of gifts as she stepped outside. At last, their long-planned celebration was successfully underway.\nPerhaps moved by their enthusiasm, Citlali drank a lot that night. As her eyes began to grow hazy, someone finally worked up the courage to ask the question that had been puzzling them all along.\n\"How old am I exactly? *hic* Let me tell you something funny...\" Citlali began, slurring her words. \"I'm certainly not the only one in this world who's lived a long, long life. For the others, it usually goes like this... In the beginning, keeping track of the years is easy, but the longer they live, the more of a hassle it becomes, so they just stop paying attention... *hiccup* But me, well... I'm a lil' different, you see... At first, I never used to worry exactly how old I was. It was only after... something happened... that I suddenly started noticing how old I was becoming... And from that moment on, I started counting, and it's been exactly... 200 years... *hic*!\"\nThe mystery behind the \"200 years\" claim had finally been solved, but her answer had sparked a new question. What could possibly have happened to make Citlali, who had remained so youthful over the past two centuries and longer, suddenly become so acutely aware of the passing of time?\nBut despite their curiosity, no one pressed her any further, for they noticed that Citlali was staring blankly at the night sky — a sign that she had already fallen asleep."

    "text": "As a young lady, Huitzilin had been Citlali's peer during their training, always accompanied by her trusty Iktomisaur companion, Claw. Whenever Huitzilin struck a battle pose, Claw would leap up and down beside her in a combined show of strength.\n\"So you're that so-called 'genius' the elders always talk about? Let's settle who's the strongest, once and for all!\"\n\"...Are you out of your mind?\"\nAs abruptly as it started, their first clash ended with Huitzilin's crushing defeat. Though, as it turned out, that was only the beginning. Every so often, Huitzilin would show up again at Citlali's doorstep with Claw in tow. The first few times, all she brought with her were fiery letters of challenge. But not long after, she started bringing snacks too. Eventually, she even brought along wine, stolen from the adults. Whether it was the fine wine that swayed her, or simply that she had resigned herself to the inevitability of Huitzilin's persistence, Citlali stopped resisting her visits.\nAnd just like that, twenty years flew by.\nUntil one day, for the first time ever, the fight ended in a draw. That was the night that Citlali finally accepted Huitzilin's invitation to share wine and snacks under the moonlight.\n\"To think that the two of us would become great shamans on the very same day... Seems like we truly are equals in that regard, after all.\"\n\"A hard-won draw's not a bad result, you know. Surely, as my rival, you're finally satisfied now? Maybe you'll even stop pestering me...\"\n\"What? No. I'll keep coming over, of course! Besides, even if we're no longer rivals, we've been friends for twenty years now, haven't we?\"\nAs the slightly tipsy Citlali gazed over at Huitzilin in the dim moonlight, something suddenly struck her. That reckless young lass from two decades past had already blossomed into a poised great shaman. Little Claw had matured too, now an imposing adult Iktomisaur standing a head taller than the two of them.\n\"Yes, friends for twenty years...\"\nAll of a sudden, Citlali's mind was aflood with memories, details that had been obscured by time's rapid flow. She felt the warmth of their bond, but also an inexplicable sense of foreboding.\nAnother twenty years flew by in the blink of an eye.\nOne day, halfway through cleaning away the graffiti of yet another challenger she had effortlessly defeated, Citlali was interrupted by the sound of familiar footsteps.\n\"Hey, old friend. It's been a while since you last asked me out for a drink. You're not mad at me, are you?\"\n\"If a fight's what you're after, why don't you just drop by yourself? Why'd you keep sending these hopeless fools to pester me, huh?\"\n\"Well, because... I've reached the age where I have to start taking on students too, y'know.\"\nCitlali turned around, as though suddenly realizing something she hadn't before. Her friend, who she hadn't seen for quite some time, now bore quite a few wrinkles, no longer the radiant youth she once was. Seeming to sense the complex emotions in Citlali's gaze, Huitzilin tried to lighten the mood, pointing to a nearby field in full bloom.\n\"No matter how beautiful Natlan's wildflowers are, they always wither when the dry season comes around. But that never worries us, because we know that the year after, the field will bloom once more. Right?\"\n\"But the flowers we see now... Not one of them will feel the warmth of the sunlight that shines down on next year's field. In the end, nothing gold can stay, can it?\"\n\"...I'm sure some hues will hold, my dear friend. Let me think it over — I'll give you your answer soon enough.\"\nHuitzilin tried in vain to soothe Citlali's apparent unease, for the latter had finally realized from whence her sense of impending crisis came. Citlali stayed wide awake that whole night, watching as portentous meteors streaked across the skies above.\nJust as leaf subsides to leaf, so too do we. By the time the next twenty-year anniversary of their friendship came around, Huitzilin was gone.\n...\nMany years later, as Citlali once again scrubbed graffiti from her wall, she thought back once again upon that afternoon when a girl and her young Iktomisaurus had come to challenge her.\nCountless memories surged back like a tide, vivid as if those moments had occurred just yesterday; yet just as quickly were they carried away again, scattered by the wind into the distant past. With long years' passing, even those emotions that Huitzilin had once failed to calm had by now been diluted, leaving only quiet sighs in their stead.\n\"You never gave me that answer, in the end,\" Citlali murmured.\nYet despite the implication of her words, Citlali had no intention of blaming Huitzilin; for she believed it was a question without answer. After a few cycles of blooming and wilting, the flower she remembered so vividly was now long gone, buried by the sands of time, as even the brightest of flowers would be."

    "text": "\"We are like birds, soaring through the horizons of time. I linger between brushes of memory, seeking the 'color' of my final journey.\"\nEach time Citlali weaves a special scroll to record a significant event, she thinks back upon this phrase of Huitzilin's. It was the first thing that Huitzilin had said as she taught her the mystic art of weaving such scrolls. Thus did she lead Citlali into a vivid realm of recollection, showing her how to craft sprawling works like a master painter; except with a palette not of paints, but of memories instead.\nAfter learning this technique, Citlali followed Huitzilin's example — adorning the record of a grand victory with a touch of fiery orange from warriors' torches, or honoring fallen heroes with a hint of pale violet from flowers laid before a grave. So were these chronicles woven into being, scroll after scroll, ensuring that the Masters of the Night-Wind's traditions would endure.\nCitlali had long understood the burden and responsibility that inheriting this mystic art entailed. So, when she was approached by that golden-haired Traveler, she knew she could not refuse their request. This time, she chose the Traveler's \"gold\" to represent the light by which the Abyss was illuminated, as well as the final full stop by which this great war was ended. Meticulously she dyed the entire scroll, the memories it contained seeming to come alive in her hands.\n\"That way, they're not lost to piles of black and white text.\"\nHearing the Traveler by her side speak these words, Citlali suddenly felt an emotion long since diluted by time well up inside her again. Remembering Huitzilin's words once more, she realized that her old friend had indeed kept her promise.\nWhen the flowers wither when the dry season comes, and all is buried by the dunes of time, what then shall remain?\n\"The color of memories, that's what.\"\nThis was the answer that Huitzilin had given all those years ago. It was also the one that Citlali was now able to give the Traveler in response to their question. She knew that it would bind her to another promise that would only be fulfilled after facing many more long years; yet this time, she felt far more resolute.\nPresenting the Traveler with a token she had prepared long ago, for the first time ever, Citlali spoke aloud the wish she hoped to fulfill over the course of her long life.\n\"I hope that my colors may abide in your memory always.\""

    "text": "\"The first is Citlalin, baleful star of the North!\"\n\"The second is Itzpapa, malefic omen of the South!\"\nWhenever someone mentions the two dolls that Citlali keeps by her side, which she refers to as her Tzitzimimeh, the Masters of the Night-Wind often respond with these words as a warning — the intention being to silence loose tongues, lest they bring down a terrible curse upon themselves. If the rumors are to be believed, these dolls house the conscious wills of some ilk of malevolent demon, subduable only by the wrath of Granny Itztli herself. As such, their names have become synonymous with Granny Itztli's own, invokable as some sort of incantation to stop a toddler's tantrum in its otherwise unstoppable tracks.\nHowever, anyone who has had the opportunity to observe these two dolls up close would find them far less intimidating than the stories might suggest. In manner and appearance, they come across more like cute little animals than fearsome demons. Though Citlali does indeed frequently hurl them at her enemies in combat, the fear instilled by this peculiar tactic pales in comparison to the terror she inspires with her own two fists.\nAnd though it is true that within these dolls is sealed the dreadful power of inauspicious stars, this has absolutely nothing to do with their consciousnesses. Citlali crafted the Tzitzimimeh using the bones of small animals that had died of natural causes. The lingering remnants of their spirits were reawakened by the dolls' bodies, which is what bestowed consciousness upon them. As such, this pair of clingy little critters bring with them no curses whatsoever — on the contrary, they bring emotional comfort in spades, akin to the kind one might find in a pet.\nFunnily enough, Citlali very rarely lets anyone know this. Though, given that she uses them as weapons, it's probably for the best that they seem a bit on the scarier side."

After reaching the age of seventy, Citlali grew reluctant to leave her home, seeming to have lost all passion for the world and only attending to matters in which her direct involvement was absolutely and unequivocally required. Naturally, such an air of detached indifference did not win her the favor of any heroic spirits.\nHowever, in places most people were not even aware of, Citlali retained a great enthusiasm for one thing: weaving the special scrolls upon which major historical events were recorded.\nEach of these scrolls required decades to complete, an entire generation swept away by the time they were done. Yet always she persisted, maybe because it was her old friend's last wish, or maybe because doing so allowed her to avoid the company of others. She neither expected to see this task through to its end, nor did she seek any response to her efforts.\n\"Just a way to pass the time,\" she told herself.\nAnd that was why, on the night a certain ancestor called out to her from the Night-Wind's mist-shrouded hues, Citlali was rather stumped.\n\"Do you believe I will inherit your Ancient Name?\"\n\"Sooner or later, you will indeed. You just do not yet know the reason why.\"\n\"But first, please, accept my message. When the time comes, it will hold the answer to your doubts.\"\nThe colors of the Night-Wind shifted, communicating in a language that only Citlali could decipher.\n\"We are like birds, soaring through the horizons of time.\"\n\"I linger in verdant forests, skim across azure waves, soar over fiery magma, gather golden ore, and chase after pink-plumed flower-feathers.\"\n\"When twilight falls, my graffiti adorns the night sky.\"\n\"All that I depict shall be gifts, given to the world of the deceased.\"\n\"This was once my name, and it will be yours as well.\"\n\"Ukumbuko, 'Memory.'\"\nWith the message complete, the Night-Wind that was shrouded in mist drifted toward the scroll that Citlali had just finished dyeing, transforming into a mysterious iridescence that illuminated the entire scene.\nAs she gazed upon the woven scroll, Citlali suddenly recalled once more the night her old friend passed away.\n\"The mission she left me... It was once yours too, was it not?\"\n\"It was indeed. But for you, it seems to be more than just a mission.\"\nFollowing a trail of shimmering colors, Citlali opened up her hand. As if from nowhere, a glimmering Vision had somehow appeared in her palm.\n\"It appears to be your 'wish' as well.\""

The story is incredibly long... The author changed three times, but in the end, the truth of the \"Houko\" was still never revealed..."

There should no longer have been residents there, but as if destiny had decreed it, a farmer had come there, picking Naku Weed to make a living. Thus it was under the moonlight that he saw a phantom figure standing on the edge of the cliff.\nThis person wore a wide hat that concealed their face entirely. However, the farmer could hear breathing through the pitter-patter of the rain.\nA moment later, the figure spoke. \"This is how humans should breathe.\"\nThe farmer was terrified that he might had encountered some spirit, and hurriedly hid behind a rock. The figure spoke again. \"What are you afraid of? Would a passerby such as I hurt you? I am merely here to tend to the grave of a friend.\"\nSilence filled the air once more. The farmer peeked out from behind the rock, and saw that the figure had vanished. A note drifted to the ground and was instantly soaked by the rain. Three questions had been written on that piece of paper, along with answers that were not yet fully written—\nIf humans have a heart, why do they not fear the hearts of others?\nDue to their inferior nature.\nHow should one treat others, knowing full well their inferiority?\n...\nHow can one be a human being without a heart?\nOne without a heart is hardly human.\nChills ran down the farmer's spine as he finished reading the note. Tatarasuna had been deserted for many years, and it had been a long time since anyone came here to pay their respects. And even if there were, why would they appear on such a night?"

Today, many of these past affairs have been forgotten.<!--\n              -->The puppet, the eccentric Kabukimono, the 6th seat of the Fatui Harbingers, The Balladeer...<!--\n              -->Each of these was a thread of fate tying the puppet's joints down.<!--\n              -->Any recollection must begin several hundred years ago, when the puppet that shed tears upon being born would not be given a name, but was instead only given a small golden feather as proof of his personage.<!--\n              -->He would be laid to rest within the Shakkei Pavilion, staring blankly at the beauteous scenery within. The flaming maple leaves, the exquisite window lattices... Within that lovely prison, he lost all perception.<!--\n              -->It was by accident that a kind-hearted samurai named Katsuragi would enter the pavilion and rescue him. It was Katsuragi who brought him to live in Tatarasuna and meet the people who lived there.<!--\n              -->Then, the puppet was as naive as a newborn, filled with goodwill and gratitude towards humans. Katsuragi, upon seeing the golden pinion on his person, knew that this puppet must not have been of ordinary stock, yet have his reasons not to mention his place of origin. Thus, he omitted all mention of Shakkei Pavilion, instead claiming falsely that he had found the young man while patroling Nazuchi Beach, and he bade the puppet play along so as to not expose the lie.<!--\n              -->Busy, bustling Tatarasuna was a place of many happy memories for the puppet. There, he was briefly human. There, he was briefly normal.<!--\n              -->Katsuragi, Mikoshi Nagamasa, Niwa, Miyazaki, and many other now-forgotten people from Tatarasuna would teach him to read and write, to start fires and make meals, to forge — yes, they accepted him as their friend.<!--\n              -->They even asked him: \"Don't you want a name? Or are you going to let everyone out there call you the Kabukimono?\"<!--\n              -->Yet he had no dislike for this name.<!--\n              -->\"Kabukimono\" referred mostly to those who wore vibrant colors and behaved in a peculiar manner. Yes, they made him different, but such was proof of his humanity — proof that he belonged in Tatarasuna.<!--\n              -->Pity, then, that though he loved this name so, he would be forced to forsake it. For when he no longer wished to become human, it lost its meaning.<!--\n              -->He would depart, and after arriving in the distant north, would join the wild banquet of the Harbingers, working to win the sixth seat among them.<!--\n              -->It was the Tsaritsa who would grant him his new title — \"The Balladeer.\" Strength, power, and the desire for conflict — these he already possessed.<!--\n              -->The chess pieces raised tides of madness amidst battle, and the slaughterers on the stage upended order.<!--\n              -->In that moment, he was sure that The Balladeer was his true name."

The two cooperated very closely to further improve forging quality, and in the process, Akame introduced Escher to Niwa, who was also from the three Isshin traditions.<!--\n              -->Escher's arrival caused quite the stir for a time, for it was through his revolutionary new techniques that they were able to process Crystal Marrow in such a way that their forging efficacy and production were both increased.<!--\n              -->But as time passed, anomalies emerged within the great central furnace in Tatarasuna. Black gas gathered within the furnace, and it would gradually affect the bodies of the craftspeople there. Forging and smelting were the foundations of life in Tatarasuna, but now they had become death itself.<!--\n              -->And as the toll mounted, the great furnace further went out of control. None could get close to its core, and even stopping it became nigh impossible.<!--\n              -->As the highest authority at Tatarasuna, Niwa was forced to enact an information blackout while sending people to Inazuma City to beg aid from Tenshukaku.<!--\n              -->For some reason, however, those who took to the sea in ships never returned. Horror began seeping into the hearts of Tatarasuna's people.<!--\n              -->The Kabukimono knew that Niwa needed the Raiden Shogun's aid, but did not know that this was the very year when she had successfully built the perfect puppet using parts of herself as material, thus handing over management of the nation to the Guardian of Eternity. He thus boarded a small boat and braved storm and rain to arrive at Tenshukaku, seeking an audience with the Shogun.<!--\n              -->But she now dwelled in the Plane of Euthymia, and he was repeatedly refused. In desperation, he displayed the golden feather on his person and asked to see Yae Miko instead.<!--\n              -->At this time, Miko was busy assisting the Guardian, and though she rushed down as soon as she heard this news, she could only meet the distressed Kabukimono briefly. Yet he had no ears for her promises to send people to their aid immediately, and returned in despair, convinced that the Shogunate had forsaken Tatarasuna.<!--\n              -->Still, the dispatch was sent, the people were mobilized, and they crossed by sea. Yet they arrived to no great disaster. Indeed, most people knew nothing of what had happened. It was the mechanic, Escher, who explained that Niwa had fled with his family for fear of punishment for his malfeasance, and that the Kabukimono had gone into the core zone in his place, shutting the furnace down.<!--\n              -->Receiving word that the Kabukimono had been friends with the fleeing Niwa, Yae guessed at the heaviness in his heart and did not wish to further disturb him, merely sending someone to return the feather to him.<!--\n              -->Later still, he would disappear without a trace from Tatarasuna. But as people reminisced, they could never forget the celebratory dance he had performed together with them on the day that Mikoshi Nagamasa successfully forged his great blade.<!--\n              -->His steps fluttered lightly like a feather in the wind then, and they could not have known that he, like a feather, would depart from them and journey to places unknown."

Seeing his constantly mud-caked face through the gaps in the decrepit wooden door, the Kabukimono felt something twist in his heart, as if some ancient feeling was being re-awakened. And so, he stayed within that wooden house to care for that sick boy, bringing him melons, fruits, and water to drink, helping him to wipe the filth from his face.<!--\n              -->Many days passed, and the child's parents did not return. It was only later that the Kabukimono learned that the parents were also workers from Tatarasuna, and they might have lived normal and happy lives, if not for husband and wife contracting some strange illness during their work, often coughing up blood as a result. That they had not returned indicated that they may have passed without any fanfare in some place out there.<!--\n              -->The child's name was unimportant, for he had another identity: he was the Kabukimono's friend, and family besides. They talked about how they had been born and promised to continue to live together in that ramshackle hut. As proof of their friendship, the Kabukimono took the boy to Shakkei Pavilion to see the place where he had once lived.<!--\n              -->The flaming maple leaves, the ancient latticed windows... All was as it had once been.<!--\n              -->At that time, he believed that he would never return here... but he did not realize that the child could die in only one night. One night, barely enough time for the Kabukimono to go out and find some food or swipe some furniture that others no longer had any use for.<!--\n              -->Though he had already witnessed much change, he never knew that another person's passing was something that could occur in such a brief moment, or that this moment could grant him nothing but pain.<!--\n              -->After the shock, he felt incomparable fury. He was alone. Again. Was he not once more abandoned?<!--\n              -->Again! Again! Again!<!--\n              -->The boy's small body on the ground was curled up like a jumble of flower petals, a corner of it stained red with blood — red like the maple leaves... red like a blazing fire.<!--\n              -->That night, a great flaming glow lit the seaside. The Kabukimono burned the wooden house, and finding himself an old straw hat from within it, left to begin his long journey.<!--\n              -->He wandered everywhere, not knowing where to go, and though he would meet many more people along the way, he would never again regard any of them as his companions."

The Doctor was fascinated by this field of study, and, using the Wanderer as a foundational blueprint, would perform research and experiments for several decades before finally attaining the techniques that would go on to form the basis for his Segments.<!--\n              -->In return, The Doctor would unlock the seal on his body, causing his abilities to greatly increase, to the point where he was a match for the lower-ranked Harbingers.<!--\n              -->But even so, he did not choose another name.

Mona's only income comes from her contributions to The Steambird's \"All Things Astrological\" column. Every paycheck is spent first on her research. Books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... all of these come with a hefty price tag, and by the time Mona regains her senses, there's only enough of her income left for her to scrape by each month.\n\"It matters not.

That's a lie.\"\"You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you.\"The cold, hard truth is laid bare before people's eyes, complete with all the grisly details that they would rather remained buried.Mona will make no exceptions to this, and as such she can seem completely lacking in human emotion.But sometimes, on a clear night, she can be seen on a high mountain slope.There, Mona gazes up at the stars in the sky — so close, she feels, that she could almost reach out and touch them — with gentle eyes, humming an unknown tune to herself."

If not for some relief funds coming from time to time, she would have had trouble eking out a living.Mona does in fact have some money set aside. Even though she must eventually run dry without an income, she can slow the bleeding by scrimping in the food department.So where does the rest of the Mora go? Well, if you've ever had a look inside her lab, then know that the big pile of astrology-related apparatus and tools in there didn't come out of thin air.In fact, all of them come with a hefty price tag — books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... The shipping fees alone are impressive.That Mona should be in abject poverty comes, therefore, as no surprise.In order to support herself, Mona eventually took up a commercial contract — her contributions to a column about constellation in The Steambird have become her most stable income source.Now having a monthly income, Mona could have left her life of poverty. But how could an astrologist's pursuit of knowledge end here?Whenever she gets paid, Mona will immediately shell out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more.This process plays out every month.Today, too, is another day Mona worries over Mora."

Some neither had food nor warm clothes, living no differently from beggars.And it was just such an adventurer who, when meeting Mona while she was out looking for fruits and vegetables to fill her stomach, shared half their food with her.\"Out here, we've gotta have each other's backs.\"This was not something inscribed on these so-called principles of the world. And many other such things she encountered on her journey — the honesty of a thief, a robber's change of heart, a coward's courage, the good deeds of a wicked person...Mona began to have some doubts, but she also felt like she finally had her feet on solid ground.When she was again alone with her thoughts under the stars, she marveled that her research had been so full of holes.Perhaps she would have to continue researching the world's principles for the rest of her life."

That she had this opportunity at all was pure chance.When the previous contributing author was traveling the world, he heard tell of a strange astrologist, and his hobbyist's curiosity compelled him to seek her out.Their correspondence left him deeply impressed.As it happened, he was also looking to retire, and seeing that Mona was strapped for Mora, reached out to help her by recommending her to the editor-in-chief of The Steambird.When Mona released her first column, \"An Introduction to Astrology,\" the column, heretofore known for being easy reading, experienced a massive shift in tone.Most of each issue was dedicated to discussing the movement of celestial bodies and other difficult (and obscure) topics. Academic quotations, dense footnotes and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings.The editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic. Would it find acceptance with long-time readers? As it turned out, there was no need to fret. The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this:\"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting. Consider me a fan of Astrologist Mona Megistus.\"After getting approval to continue submitting manuscripts, Mona could finally heave a sigh of relief.Now, how best to celebrate... Ah yes.

Mona seeks the final truth of the world, hidden amidst the sea of stars.As such, she does not have any reverence for her Vision, which the people of this world consider to be a sign of divine favor and the source of all power.Nonetheless, this item that serves no practical use in her hands is something that she treasures greatly.It was gifted to her by her teacher as a teaching aid, and it is the only evidence of their time together as master and pupil.She preserves these distant memories with great care.

The knights stationed in the mountains and valleys are often the target of sneak attacks from monsters, but Eula has always been able to resolve these crises by rendering swift support. She has also led proactive attacks to destroy Abyss Order strongholds time and again, nipping their nefarious plots in the bud.\nDue to Eula's background, many contradictions surround her &mdash; she is a descendant of the Lawrence clan and is considered by the citizens of Mondstadt to be the embodiment of the blood of sinners. Despite everything, she severed ties with her clan many years ago and joined the Knights of Favonius. Yet prejudice is not so easily dispelled, and Eula has not been treated fairly. In the eyes of Mondstadt's citizens, she remains an \"outsider,\" or even a \"dangerous individual.\"\nYears of such experiences have led Eula to build an invisible shield to protect herself from unwarranted harm. The term \"vengeance\" is perhaps the most visible edge of this shield. Only by disregarding wild gossip and trying to accept the logic of her approach to the world can one come to understand the truth behind the complex shell of this young woman."

    "text": "Eula's role within the Knights of Favonius is Captain of the Reconnaisance Company.The nature of her work means that she rarely sets foot in the city — she spends most of her time out in the wild, leading her team of scouts as they hunt down Abyss Order operatives and other monsters.Known as the Spindrift Knight, Eula wields her blade with consummate skill, but perhaps more importantly, she is well-versed in strategy and possesses great courage and excellent intuition. Grand Master Varka had nothing but the highest praise for her, even declaring once that she was the Dandelion Knight's equal on the battlefield.On the face of it, to have two such outstanding knights attending to the defense of Mondstadt in a single generation should be a cause for nothing but celebration. But dig a little deeper and there is a fundamental difference between Jean and Eula.For Eula is a descendant of the once-aristocratic Lawrence Clan. The blood that flows through her veins once flowed through those of Mondstadt's oppressors during one of the darkest periods of the city's history.Consequently, Eula has been viewed with contempt by the citizens of Mondstadt since birth. The Lawrence name stands for a legacy of depravity and despotism that stains Mondstadt's past and scars the minds of its citizens even to this day.So, whenever Eula appears, old wounds resurface. People despise the aristocracy, and this does no favors for her reputation.However, Eula is strong-willed and in spite of everything, she joined the Knights of Favonius and rose to the rank of Captain.When people in the city voiced their reservations, she would respond head-on, claiming that her chosen course of action was out of a desire for \"vengeance.\" This matter-of-fact confession would alarm them all the more and has convinced everyone that she joined the Knights of Favonius only to serve as a mole for the former aristocracy.One person who sees things differently is Acting Grand Master Jean. In fact, she speaks rather fondly of Eula.\"The rumors are all groundless. The Spindrift Knight is simply misunderstood, that's all.\""

On the other, she is one of the top two sword fighters in Mondstadt.In other words, Eula is equal parts tainted blood and superior swordsmanship.There is no knowing when she might strike, nor what she might take from you... In the eyes of the citizens of Mondstadt, the Reconnaissance Captain is as unpredictable and tumultuous as the waves on a stormy sea.Eula responds with a cold haughtiness to accusations of this nature. To any who dare insinuate such things to her face, she replies, \"How dare you. Hmph, I will remember this.\"She is consumed by the desire to avenge herself, but is often on the move far away from the city. Sometimes upon her return to Mondstadt, she will brandish her greatsword and march straight to the Knights of Favonius headquarters.On one occasion, two fresh recruits standing guard on their first day on patrol watched this scene play out before their eyes. Alarmed and unsure how to respond, they ultimately did not dare to intervene. Instead, they simply watched on helplessly while Eula made a beeline for Master Jean's office.Much to their surprise, however, hours passed and no sound of a struggle was heard from within.Still worried, the guards raised their concerns to Cavalry Captain Kaeya and Librarian Lisa as they were passing by.\"The Reconnaissance Captain is back again? When you saw her, was it when she was marching towards Jean's office with her sword in hand, looking like she wanted to kill somebody?\"\"Goodness, I must head there straight away. How can they have a tea break without me?\"Lisa hurried to Jean's office the moment she finished speaking. Meanwhile, Kaeya took the two guards outside and explained to them whilst trying to suppress a fit of the giggles:\"We all know that the Acting Grand Master is a good judge of character, don't we? The Knights of Favonius are interested in a person's ability, not their family history. That's why she gives up her time to spar with the Reconnaissance Captain. In doing so, she can preserve the dignity of the Knights of Favonius while also providing a way of settling old grievances. Quite brilliant, don't you think?\"\"Ohh... S—So that's how it is...\" \"...So 'tea break' is code for 'sparring'...?\"This kind of thing occurs almost on a monthly basis. But... if they're engaged in some sort of strange sparring ritual in there for the sake of settling old grievances and honing their fighting skills... How come they don't make a ton of noise?"

On the contrary, constantly being met with prejudice at every turn means she is often the victim.At one time, shops would refuse to sell her their goods, restaurants would put no care and attention into her orders, and the citizens on her patrol route would refuse to cooperate with her. So, Eula's work is fraught with difficulties.When conflict arises, Eula fights back with a sternly worded threat to indicate that she will remember this grievance and make the offending party pay for it one day. It seems to work like a magic spell, because as soon as these words are uttered, the conflict ceases immediately without ever having to escalate to the level of an all-out confrontation.Funnily enough, although people always have their guard up around Eula, she is a law-abiding citizen and has never harmed another Mondstadter in her life. She may come across as having a somewhat frosty demeanor, but she is entirely scrupulous in her speech and conduct.No one can ever find fault with her actions, and as people gradually get to know her, their morbid fear of her will dissipate. They will also start to realize her threats of vengeance are nothing more than a figure of speech that simply serve as a verbal warning in the moment.Eula, who may or may not be working to bring down the Knights of Favonius from the inside... Eula, who may or may not be an aristocrat mole... New recruits in the Knights of Favonius find her the most difficult person to deal with.When Jean sends a new recruit to track down Eula in the wilds and deliver a new set of verbal orders, they always receive the same response: \"If you have to resort to tasking the descendant of your former oppressors with doing your work, then perhaps you are not as strong as I thought.\"But despite the antagonism in her words, she will complete her newly assigned tasks to perfection. The new recruit is invariably forced to admit that with her abilities, it is no wonder she was able to achieve a captaincy within just a few years of joining the Knights.Everyone knows Eula is the frosty and antagonistic Spindrift Knight, the aristocrat who has a score to settle with the Knights of Favonius, the openly hostile and potentially dangerous individual... but is this really the truth of who she is?On the way back, the new recruit thinks back over Eula's every action.\"What was that kind and resilient look I saw in her eyes when she wasn't looking at me?

If they're in an especially good mood, they may even exchange a few words with her during the process. It is at moments like this that Eula shows her most agreeable side.Because of this, and because Amber is just so nice, she'll often accompany Eula on trips out, or even run all her errands for her and deliver the goods straight to her home.Amber is also the reason that the city folk end up hearing all about the Reconnaissance Captain's accomplishments out in the field. Each time Amber informs them of Eula's long list of achievements in battle, they can't help but let out a little gasp of surprise.Early one weekend morning, Amber stood atop a makeshift stage of wooden crates and began announcing Eula's latest highlights: \"Recently, the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Captain saved the life of a woman at Dornman Port. After further investigation with this woman's close cooperation, she then proceeded to successfully capture all the Abyss Order operatives hiding in the vicinity of the port. The woman in question was a renowned legal expert from Liyue, and the Knights of Favonius have since received official correspondence from the Liyue Communications Office thanking the Reconnaissance Captain for her deeds...\"Whether because Amber's persistent efforts have overcome historical prejudices or because Eula's achievements as a knight have quelled the long-standing fear in people's hearts, Eula's life has changed noticeably in recent years. Most of the city folk are no longer openly hostile towards her, and she has won over the members of the Knights of Favonius with her consistent results in the field.As for the members of the Reconnaissance Company under her leadership, they support her unconditionally. They always have her back when they head out to Mondstadt's outskirts to defend the peace of their nation.Of course, the person who has always tirelessly rooted for Eula, and who is now the most delighted to see people's attitudes towards her change, is Amber. They had been friends for a long time before Eula ever joined the Knights of Favonius, and as the beloved mentee of Amber's grandfather, the first Outrider, Eula has her complete trust."

One staple of their inventory is a moon-shaped pie. Though a field ration, this wonderfully delicious and highly portable food is loved by all who try it.The Reconnaissance Company's designated chef once admitted that when developing this item, she was inspired by the captain's own baked goods. She extended the baking time to make the crust tougher and also substituted a few highly perishable ingredients with ones that last longer, reducing the cost while significantly prolonging the shelf life.Even after such a major change to the recipe, the pie still tasted delicious. So, whenever the scouts are snacking, they can't help but wonder: If this is the field ration version, how delicious must the captain's original recipe taste?The answer to this question is buried deep within the pages of a dusty old book in the library. The Lawrence Clan may have been overthrown a long time ago, but they have never given up hope of one day rising again and reclaiming their place as the ruling class. So that they are always prepared for this monumental moment, their offspring are subjected to an educational regime so unbelievably harsh that it is considered borderline abusive.\"Noble obligations\" must be performed to absolute perfection in every possible sense, and these obligations cover etiquette, ritual, and study as well as cooking and other domestic chores.In the eyes of the Lawrence Clan, \"Post-liberation Mondstadt lacks etiquette and taste. When the day comes for our clan to seize power once more, there shall be none who are qualified to be our servants. We must be cautious. We must never stoop to the level of the commoners and set foot in the quagmire of vulgarity.\"The Lawrence Clan's culinary arts teacher was particularly strict. If your dough was missing a half-spoonful of flour, or if your condiment was a few grains of salt short, or if you were two seconds late removing something from the oven, you were likely to be both scolded and disciplined. As far as Eula is concerned, the haute cuisine revered by the aristocrats is just another worthless consequence of people dogmatically following outdated rules.For this reason, the only kind of person who Eula will permit to try her own home baking is someone who she... respects...? No, that would be taking it too far. Rather, it should be someone who she grudgingly accepts \"will keep following me around and bothering me, seemingly undeterred by my warnings, despite having crossed me many times to date.\""

Bleeding toes were seen as a point of pride and a rite of passage for every dancer.This ancient ceremony was a continuous tradition for so long that even today, long after being expelled by the people of Mondstadt, the Lawrence Clan still honors it.However, without the grand banquet and the gorgeous stage that once featured prominently in ceremonial performances, the Dance of Sacrifice is now far from the grandiose affair it once was. Furthermore, the stringent requirements regarding the dancer's posture and movements have also been relaxed due to the lack of tutors. In the end, the Lawrence Clan reluctantly decided that it could no longer be a mandatory part of the curriculum, and they relegated it to an artistic pastime.Over time, the negative connotations and elitist expectations associated with this dance have faded away, and today it survives simply as a graceful dance.As the eldest daughter of the present-day Lawrence Clan, Eula found it to be a relaxing pastime in her youth and a welcome respite from her other grueling courses of study.Today, Eula appears to have put her artistic pursuits behind her. At least, no one pictures dancing when they think of the Spindrift Knight.Nevertheless, a distinctly dance-like aesthetic can be observed in Eula's bladework, along with an elegant rhythm and musicality that are difficult to capture in words.As her greatsword rises and falls and sways to and fro, her distinctive and graceful poise is like that of a dancer under the moonlight: faraway, immaculate, and sublime."

Then she departed with that badge of honor in her possession and has barely contacted the clan since.Her icy sword is a manifestation of the strength represented by the seal, striking with the cold, brutal force of a relentless blizzard and driving her foes into retreat.Yet, sharp and bright as ice as she is, she has the title of \"Spindrift Knight,\" a name that leads many who hear it to assume that she manipulates Hydro instead of Cryo.There is a story behind that misunderstanding — the story of a habit.Eula carries an exquisitely crafted bone whistle with her at all times. Each time she blows it, the vivid sound of ocean waves rings out loud and clear, far and wide.Since the area her company is in charge of borders the sea, reproducing the sound of waves can be an excellent means of disturbing the enemy's judgment, or of deceiving less intelligent monsters into believing that a tsunami is inbound, causing them to flee in panic.Using this unique combat tactic has helped Eula emerge victorious against larger forces than her own on numerous occasions, and has also earned her the moniker of \"Spindrift Knight.\"Of course, a bone whistle is capable of imitating many other sounds, and Eula has her reasons for imitating the ocean waves.It would seem that something akin to the \"Glacier Knight\" should suit her better.But perhaps Eula herself prefers the rolling waves to the cold and unyielding ice...Roaming freely across the world, gentle but firm with the reefs and sands in their dominion...Yes, she yearns not to be sharp and rigid like ice, but to be free and unbound like the ocean spray."

These things were utterly unimportant to Eula.She never experienced the great humiliation of her clan — and all the torment she had endured in life had been at their own hands. She attempted to free herself from their shackles, yet struggled to obtain recognition from the outside world.Her talk of grievances and vengeance was but a habit, a signal, a shield.For someone in her unique circumstances and position, what remarks should she just laugh off, and what ideas should she hold onto?How should she fight this battle to break free, once and for all, from the great burden of her bloodline?It was with all these questions and more circling around in her mind that Eula came under the tutelage of a long-forgotten old outrider. From him, she learned an open-mindedness and down-to-earth persistence that she had never previously encountered.Before grappling with grievances and vengeance, before questions of clan and outsider, she first had to discover herself.Her survival mechanism... her means of self-preservation... her grit and determination...She may articulate it in terms of \"grievances\" and \"vengeance,\" but nothing can change what it is at its core: something both strong and kind.Eula finally found herself on a gentle path of revenge that was hers alone... and the moment she set foot on that path, there it appeared before her — her Vision."

People love to tell epic tales of her earth-shattering (or rather, sea-splitting) feats. tales in which her abilities are exaggerated to almost superhuman levels.One rumor is that she can channel Electro energy with her sword. It is said that she once used it to cut a formidable sea monster from the depths of the ocean abyss in half with just one hit.Bystanders who overhear such tales generally dismiss them as drunken ramblings.

And yet, on one voyage when The Crux encountered a strong storm, Beidou noticed a small private boat nearby. Seeing the way it was tossed about by the waves, she ordered her crew to tow the boat to safety — despite the risk that her ship's keel might give way. What little food and water the fleet had left, Beidou shared with the rescued crew as she navigated her vessel onward through the raging storm.Finally, after several days, The Crux delivered the rescued boat to a safe mooring spot. Grateful to Beidou for saving their lives, the crew of the rescued boat became her loyal trade partners thereafter.After Liyue locals recount this story, they smile and insist, \"When you have someone risking their life like that, you can be sure that it takes far more than commodification to explain their actions!

I'll have you know that I intend to transcend Liyue's two warring culinary styles with my cooking...\"Beidou merely smiled and gestured to the chest of gold coins beside her: \"Just do what you're good at. We made quite a bit on our last run. How does a retainer of fifty thousand Mora sound?\"Not one to shy away for a chance to prove the worth of her cooking, Xiangling took the job.When the day was done, Beidou was indeed won over by Xiangling's skill. She declared in front of her crew that Xiangling would soon be a renowned chef throughout Liyue. She also insisted that they refer to her as \"Madam Xiangling.\"Having only begun to make her name, Xiangling admired Beidou for her generosity with money and her direct personality. Thereafter, Xiangling would sail with Beidou often, looking for new and exotic seafood ingredients. She found herself surprised by Beidou's vast knowledge of seafood and their culinary preparation, given how far she usually was from any kitchen.Of course, that didn't mean Xiangling would necessarily heed Beidou's advice on whether something was edible or not...but that is a story for another time."

Whenever the mists gather over the sea's surface, one can hear the distant song of the fishermen hidden in the white shroud: \"its fins formed the oceans deep, its tail the mountains high...\"This was Beidou's childhood lullaby. The tale of Rex Lapis smiting the sea monsters had become legendary among the people of Liyue. As a child, Beidou loved tales like this, and in her dreams, she thought: One day, I want to see this big fish too.This day, however, she sang this song with a different emotion in her heart. Her entire crew sang along as they sailed.Haishan was in the waters with them — at once like a dragon and a fish, it was larger than any could have imagined in their worst nightmares, and mighty as a deity, raising waves dozens of meters high with ease.All who ply their trade on the high seas are destined to meet Haishan eventually. Beidou had longed to do so since she was nine, dreaming of slicing its head off in a single blow.Many times she had challenged the creature, and many times she had failed. But this day was different. This day she charged at Haishan with her best greatsword in hand, and crack sailors at her back.The battle would rage fiercely for four days. With cannons and harpoons, arrows and ropes the fleet would assail Haishan, while Beidou battled the thusly tied-down creature for ten hours, well into the night.Now, nighttime was when Haishan was in its element, and in their vigilance not a single member of the fleet dared sleep a wink. Beidou stood upon the prow, listening to the wind.One strike. Just one strike. That was all she needed. And so she waited, unmoving, in the freezing wind.Then, at the crack of dawn, having neither eaten nor drank throughout the night, Beidou heard a change in the sound of the waves.With one almighty strike that sounded as if it could have sliced the moon in two or ripped a mountain from the face of the world, she chopped the leviathan's head clean off!The sound of thunder filled the heavens, and a single bolt of purple lightning struck the ocean right in front of Beidou, even as she bathed in the blood of her nemesis.Thus descended a Vision to the slayer of the sea monster, its violet glow as stunning as lightning, and its immaculate, jeweled form a treasure more precious than dragon blood. A suitably divine gift for the hero who subdued Haishan."

    "text": "Second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Xingqiu has had a reputation for being studious and polite ever since he was a young child. Parents in Liyue Harbor would speak adoringly of him, all secretly hoping that their own children would show as much promise as Xingqiu.\nBut even at a young age, mild-mannered Xingqiu had a wilder side too. Unbeknownst to his father and elder brother, he would sit for hours in the classroom reading fiction, having hollowed out used textbooks and snuck martial arts novels inside. After classes, he'd go out exploring and looking for all sorts of little ways to cause mischief.\nSometimes, his antics would even end up embroiling the Feiyun Commerce Guild in controversy. Luckily for Xingqiu, he always managed avoid blame by hiding behind an insurmountable wall of eloquent filibustering. Since no-one had quite what it took to beat him in an argument, eventually people simply learned to put up with his eccentricities.\nAn avid reader, Xingqiu's lifelong dream is to be the real-life embodiment of the chivalrous heroes from the pages of his books. For Xingqiu, chivalry is more than a standard of conduct &mdash; it's a mindset. The most chivalrous of all are not deterred by setbacks, nor do they stop to indulge their sense of satisfaction when things turn out as hoped. Instead, their minds are focused at all times on seizing the next opportunity to advance the cause of compassion and justice.\nDespite his young age, Xingqiu has already mastered the chivalric code and cultivated the eccentric mindset that comes along with it. This gave him a knack for the style of martial arts practiced by the Guhua Clan, and he gained some renown for effectively starting a Guhua renaissance. However, eager devotees who flock to the Guhua Clan's gates in search of the master himself may be disappointed to hear the gatekeeper's awkward response: \"The master is off in the mountains taking some time to himself right now... Maybe try again another day.\""

However, Xingqiu possesses a unique scholarly talent among his peers — that is, the offspring of Liyue's wealthiest merchants — and was often praised by his tutors as a young student.Xingqiu's elder brother, while learning the family business from their father, firmly believed that Xingqiu would become a great asset to the business one day.However, little did he know that Xingqiu, after finishing the dauntingly thick volumes on commerce and philosophy, would hollow them out and sneak martial art novels into them, which he read incessantly thereafter.Sometimes, Xingqiu suddenly disappears for hours at a time with no explanation.

Xingqiu is growing up after all... Don't want to be lecturing him all the time... Puberty perhaps?\"Afterwards, even Xingqiu found it odd.

Much to his dismay, Xingqiu quickly discovered that Guhua was a dying art that had been in constant decline for years. There was no proper tuition and it turned out the luxury dojo he had signed up in didn't even belong to the clan — they had just rented it temporarily to keep up appearances.Xingqiu's father was, of course, fully aware of this state of affairs in advance. To him, the whole thing was just for fun. He thought Xingqiu would be content to learn a spot of bladework for show, not for serious self-defense.He hadn't counted on the prodigiously intelligent and extremely well-read Xingqiu being as outstanding a talent in Guhua as he was in every other discipline he had turned his hand to. A combination of his own intuition and extensive knowledge of ancient literature meant he was able to completely revitalize the dead art.Xingqiu was disappointed by Guhua's martial arts program at the beginning, but he found the other tricks they taught to be exactly what he had hoped for.Quicklime, smoking sand, paper fish, sword-swallowing, fire-breathing... Xingqiu was spoilt for choice.He decided on the spot that he would learn them all, no matter how long it would take him. He reasoned that they would be useful to have in his repertoire during his future exploits as a chivalrous hero."

Notions of chivalry should have gradually left him as he grew up.However, obtaining a Vision changed everything — it meant he was finally able accomplish those legendary deeds he could only dream of as a child.Of course, there is no way he can completely divest himself of his duties in the Guild, but so long as he gets to go out and be the hero even occasionally, he is perfectly content with his life.The only thing that can wipe the smile from Xingqiu's face is when cynics question the true motives of chivalrous heroes.Rank, reputation, reward, shadowy deals... Whenever Xingqiu hears people smearing the names of true heroes, the expression on his face may not change, but he will be sure to add that person to the special section of his blacklist reserved for people he despises even more than carrots."

But just as the publishers had suspected, it failed to garner much interest from readers. This was quite a blow to Xingqiu's confidence.Unbeknownst to him, however, a passing merchant from Inazuma did purchase a copy to bring home, where it received rave reviews.

    "text": "The martial arts school known as the Guhua Clan has been in decline for several hundred years now. In its heyday, the name of the Clan rang like steel throughout the harbor. It was said that the Clan harbored three great secret arts — the ways of the \"Light Piercer\" for polearms, \"Rain Cutter\" for swords, and \"Life Ender\" for those who excelled in both. The three arts would be refined over the generations, and with time would reach their apex. Yet the Clan's strength would continue to wane, leading to them losing their influence... The three arts became diamonds hidden in the rough, quietly awaiting a successor.After many years, the Guhua Clan would finally get one in Xingqiu. It was he who successfully grasped the ancient \"Martial Principle\" after merely four years of study.The Guhua weapon arts stress using the weapon as an extension of your body, and indeed this is a common idea amongst the various schools of martial arts in Liyue. But the way Xingqiu saw it, the basis of the polearm and sword was the use of a Vision. Martial artists were meant to see a Vision as an extension of themselves, and see their weapon as an extension of the Vision. Hence, he says: the arts of both the polearm and the sword are just the art of the \"eye.\" Having come to this epiphany, Xingqiu took up a quill and penned a verse on the Martial Principle. Reading it, the Guhua head was shaken with tears, declaring that \"it is not Xingqiu who needs the Guhua Clan, but the Guhua Clan that needs Xingqiu.\" Since then, this verse has been sealed up at the Clan headquarters at Wangshan Hall. Disciples are proscribed from reading it, much less outsiders.The verse reads thus:Guhua's arts I have studied long, in its secrets I am trained, now its long-lost depths fall upon me like the coming of blessed rain.The beating heart of Guhua's sword art is as a shower of floating flowers. One amidst may seize a bloom, but those without read only doom.The Guhua lance is a lantern's dance, like flames in night's deep glooming. Like sparks, they scatter with ease in the dark, then join like the daybreak looming.They say the sword is as your arm — I say its glint is the beholder's eye, a light like the bright dawn coming.Those who wander are burdened not. Freely they cut rain, and enlightened they pierce light. Like a snaking dragon, they cannot be subdued. In their right eye the blade, and in the other the spear.This text should have been free for all to read. The only reason why it was sealed is the dreadful handwriting."

A young lady who sought to prepare by tightly wrapping lengths of cloth around her hand so that she would not lose her grip on the hilt of her sword. Before she knew it, the strips of cloth had been cut off one by one with pinpoint precision, and her weapon sent spinning up into the air with such ease that it resembled a sewing needle. Or those flustered \"gentlemen,\" somewhat of a recurring type, who turn up sporting all sorts of hidden gadgets from head to toe — pistolets stuffed into their hats, daggers in their shoes, powder bottles up their sleeves. Once their tricks have been spent, they end up being thrown on their backsides without exception, now facing the additional charge of \"contempt of court.\" And that's not even to mention those desperate individuals who, by leveraging all means available to them, seek to curry favor before the duel has even begun, painting themselves as victims in a vain attempt to win the people's sympathy. But this doesn't change the inevitability of their defeat in the dueling ring. After all, a sword tarnished by a sheath of lies is no use for cutting anything.<!--\n              -->But there is a benefit to the existence of this motley crew of failed scoundrels and slapstick comedians — namely, they serve as counterexamples helping the crowds recognize those others who are willing to duel with real honor, and when there is indeed some truth in the \"justice\" that they proclaim. Even if such a person ends up losing, people will listen to what they have to say — for they see that this is someone who stands firmly by their beliefs, and has the courage to draw a sword in their defense.<!--\n              -->Some say that when Miss Clorinde fights such individuals, she holds back slightly and never uses her full strength. A member of the audience, having once witnessed such a duel up close, even swore up and down that he saw the corner of Miss Clorinde's mouth curl up very slightly in what must have been approval. And surely, it is only in facing such opponents that the true meaning of the word \"duel\" is given its full expression, no?<!--\n              -->But Clorinde cares not whether the audience is moved by her duels, nor to hear the internal monologues they might inspire.<!--\n              -->As far as this Champion Duelist is concerned, the only meaning to be taken from a duel comes from facing your opponent on fair terms to determine a winner, a loser, and the righteous cause."

Yet once peace had finally been restored throughout the land, the name of the \"Marechaussee Hunters\" gradually fell into obscurity.<!--\n              -->Today, when the people of Fontaine speak of the Marechaussee Hunters, most know only of the \"Hunter's Oath,\" having heard it mentioned in some play or novel.<!--\n              -->\"From this day, I pass the candle's shadow-veil.\"<!--\n              -->\"Now, as we face the perils of the long night...\"<!--\n              -->\"I pledge to remember the oath of daylight.\"<!--\n              -->\"To enshrine tears, life, and love.\"<!--\n              -->\"Holding dawn's coming as my votive.\"<!--\n              -->\"And so shall I never despair.\"<!--\n              -->For most Fontainians, the story of the Marechaussee Hunters is now but a legend full of drama and excitement.<!--\n              -->But to Clorinde, the deeds and oaths of the Hunters are her living, breathing inheritance.<!--\n              -->The first thing she learned from her mentor, the Marechaussee Hunter Petronilla, was the swordsmanship required to slay monsters. The approach of the Hunter requires them to stay as close as possible to their prey so that they might plunge their blade into weak points with lightning-fast agility. To train her in this technique, Petronilla consigned Clorinde to a room filled with rotating pillars, each of which had been set up with many wooden swords protruding outwards, their tips covered with cloth bags.<!--\n              -->\"They might contain candy, or they might contain metallic sand. Or perhaps they'll contain all the hair I've lost while teaching you...\"<!--\n              -->\"You can chop open these bags or simply avoid them.

Remember, try to reserve enough strength to eat. Alright, begin!\"<!--\n              -->By undergoing such training, Clorinde not only developed the Marechaussee Hunter's skills of marksmanship, tracking, camouflage, and footwork, but also learned their method of quickly revealing their identity when encountering fellow Hunters in order to avoid accidental injury.<!--\n              -->Yet Clorinde has never mentioned the hardships she endured during her training to anyone else. After all, she is now a Champion Duelist of the Trial Court, not a Marechaussee Hunter from centuries past.<!--\n              -->She trusts that her mentor, who left without so much as saying goodbye, would understand her decision. The Marechaussee Hunters once wielded their swords to slay fierce monsters in defense of Fontaine's peace and stability. It is only natural, then, that their inheritor should do so to strike down lawless villains.<!--\n              -->Even if her mentor had objected, Clorinde would not have minded settling their debate in the time-honored fashion of the Marechaussee Hunters.<!--\n              -->After all, as Ms. Petronilla once said herself, if Clorinde could defeat her, she'd be willing to listen to the latter's dissenting opinion."

With the \"Welcome!\" he'd normally have greeted a new face with stuck in his throat, all he could do was stand there, not knowing what to say.<!--\n              -->After much consideration, just as this \"Welcome!\" was about to come out as \"Please, have mercy!\" Navia, who had followed Clorinde in, laughed and began to speak.<!--\n              -->\"My friend here has expressed an interest in experiencing the Tabletop Troupe for herself! So, how about it? Any fun scripts you'd recommend?\"<!--\n              -->\"She's no beginner though. She can be very picky about script quality, so make sure it's the best one you've got!\"<!--\n              -->To give the boss some credit, though he still failed to produce any semblance of a \"Welcome!\" he did manage to turn \"Please, have mercy!\" into something... Well, not quite as embarrassing, at least.<!--\n              -->Namely... \"Uh!?\"<!--\n              -->He then proceeded to rush about like a headless chicken, gathering up nearly all the scripts in the store. He brought them everything from their most popular script, \"Era of the Bronze Oath,\" to their most complex story, \"Chronicle of the Spiral Ring,\" to the irreplaceable classic, \"Valley of the Gray Wolf: 3rd Edition: 2nd Expansion\"...<!--\n              -->After this somewhat unorthodox \"ice breaker,\" the Tabletop Troupe suddenly found it had a new regular: Clorinde. Following an initial period where they were likewise immobilized by astonishment, the other customers gradually mustered up the courage to invite her to play the latest scripts with them. Presented with such expectant invitations, she said yes to them all.<!--\n              -->They were soon to find out that, regardless of which script they played, this \"new player\" invariably demonstrated an unparalleled aptitude for roleplaying. No matter how small, she never missed a single clue in the script, nor the chance to make the most of it, following up leads with precision so that the story would develop in the most natural way imaginable.<!--\n              -->On top of this, everything that Clorinde did was always completely in line with all the rules. Many of those who have played with her have come away expressing sentiments along the lines of: \"Miss Clorinde's so in control, it feels like she's a Game Master rather than another player like us!\"<!--\n              -->Hearing such things, Clorinde would only ever give a noncommittal smile in response. It's not like she could admit that the only reason she found it all so easy was that she'd been the Game Master for Navia's scripts all this time — and thanks to her friend's endless barrage of weird and wonderful ideas, had been thoroughly trained in the art of quick thinking — could she? It would be such a long, complicated thing to explain...<!--\n              -->But after having enjoyed the experience of being just a regular player, Clorinde decided to take up the mantle as Game Master once more, if for no other reason than to save the Tabletop Troupe's own, entirely blameless Game Masters from being perpetually tormented by Navia's endlessly active imagination. And for the boss, the other customers, and even Navia herself... it turned out to be a critical success!<!--\n              -->After all, no one in the room could claim to understand the meaning of \"impartiality\" better than this Champion Duelist. No bribes could sway her when she was presiding over a script — not even cake, fries, or Bulle Fruit!<!--\n              -->In the face of such temptations, she'd simply watch as the players racked their brains for a solution, then flip over the rulebook and reply: \"We've still got plenty of time. Keep thinking.\"<!--\n              -->When yet another script reached its conclusion under Clorinde's masterful guidance, a certain young Gestionnaire turned to their companions, laughed, and said:<!--\n              -->\"And to think, we all used to imagine that Miss Clorinde spent the entirety of her waking hours dealing with duel-related matters!\"<!--\n              -->As she tidied up the table, Clorinde stopped to think for a moment, then with a slight shake of her head, responded:<!--\n              -->\"I don't tend to work evenings.\""

    "text": "As Clorinde sees it, there is no difference between the duties of a Champion Duelist and a Marechaussee Hunter.<!--\n              -->Marechaussee Hunters fought to defend the peace of Fontaine by hunting down monsters that ravaged the land. As representatives of Fontainian law and order, Champion Duelists punish criminals who attempt to exploit its loopholes and shortcomings for personal gain. Moreover, their existence not only gives those who wish to defend their honor the chance of a fair duel, but also an opportunity to speak for themselves.<!--\n              -->But once the dust has settled and the wrongdoers have all been punished, what are those who fight for justice to do with the swords they took up in its name?<!--\n              -->Petronilla once told Clorinde the tale of a Marechaussee Hunter who became obsessed with exterminating monsters. When the day came that the land had been cleansed of their shadow, it didn't take long before he began to feel lost. After a life spent hunting monsters, what purpose did his life have now that their mortal enemy had been vanquished? After giving the matter much thought, he decided to carry on living as he had, severing his connections with the Marechaussee Hunters so that he might continue hunting down monsters alone... Petronilla did not say what became of him in the end, only the following:<!--\n              -->\"When a sword has forsaken its scabbard, the most it can hope for is simply to rust away.\"<!--\n              -->This seemed to confuse Clorinde, who was still a child at the time. Seeing this, Petronilla raised up the coffee spoon in her hand, then pointed it at a cube of sugar and asked:<!--\n              -->\"Clorinde, can you tell me what this is? This is an important question, now. You'll get a glass of Bulle Fruit Juice if you can answer it correctly.\"<!--\n              -->Clorinde blinked, then with a slight hint of uncertainty in her voice, answered: \"It's... a sugar cube?\"<!--\n              -->\"So you are on the ball then... Remember your answer, Clorinde.\" replied the veteran Marechaussee Hunter. \"When someone points at a sugar cube with a coffee spoon, they want you to focus on the sugar, not the spoon they're using to point at it.\"<!--\n              -->\"The whole reason that the Marechaussee Hunters fight is to restore peace to everyone's lives. Of course, this 'everyone' includes themselves.\"<!--\n              -->\"The sugar cube you're after is a happy, peaceful life. Fighting is merely the spoon you use to get it.\"<!--\n              -->\"Remember what you're fighting for, and never let the means become the end.\"<!--\n              -->\"Otherwise, you'll turn into the fool who sees only the spoon, not the sugar — and your coffee will forevermore taste unbearably bitter.\"<!--\n              -->As dusk fell, the first lights began to illuminate the Court of Fontaine. People rushed to and fro across the city, scenes of mirth and merriment all over.<!--\n              -->Clorinde sat there finishing off the last drops of her coffee, Café Lutece's latest creation. She'd been intrigued when she heard that the base was made from fresh, in-season fruit juice instead of the usual syrup they use to neutralize the taste.<!--\n              -->Tomorrow's my day off, she thought to herself. I'll get a good night's sleep, then head out early to buy some flowers and fruit. I'm meeting Navia in the afternoon over at the Tabletop Troupe to play through their latest script.<!--\n              -->Looks like it's going to be a busy day...<!--\n              -->Spearing her last crumb of cake, the undefeated Champion Duelist popped it into her mouth, savored its exquisite texture, then stood up and left."

Even Mr. Callas, who always seemed to know everything, hadn't the slightest idea where the Marechaussee Hunter had gone. Not only did Clorinde turn the whole room inside out; she also went back to all the places where she had once trained to search for clues; but in the end, there was nothing that might indicate where her mentor had gone. In all her searching, the only thing she found was a long, slim, dark blue cape hanging in the closet.<!--\n              -->Clorinde had never seen her mentor wear this cape before; she always wore a black one. Even if Clorinde had somehow managed to forget this, the Gardes who Petronilla had often run rings around — combined with all the wanted posters pasted on walls throughout the city — would have reminded her anyway.<!--\n              -->...But on the inside of the cape, you could clearly make out the unmistakable imprint of the Marechaussee Hunter's insignia. There was also a necklace with a dagger-shaped pendant that had her name carved into it — a belated birthday gift, it seemed.<!--\n              -->But this cape and the insignia upon it... Were they really a parting gift, or just another one of her mentor's tests?<!--\n              -->Clorinde couldn't tell, but she kept the items nonetheless.<!--\n              -->If it was a test, then she'd do everything in her power to prepare for the final trial that awaited her.<!--\n              -->Even if the trial should span the rest of her life."

    "text": "Within the first five minutes, Clorinde had disarmed the examiner. At first, he simply looked like his patience was wearing thin; but now, all that was left was shock. It wasn't long after before she'd left the three other duelists, who had rushed down upon hearing the news, speechless in the dueling ring. The normally cold and cheerless courts were soon bustling with excitement, almost to the point of becoming unbearably loud. The \"Duelist's Trial,\" which in theory was only supposed to last three rounds, was — thanks to the enthusiasm of the duelists — fast developing into a fully-fledged \"King of the Hill\" gauntlet. Clorinde had no objection to this, her only reply being expressed through the sword in her hand. From start to finish, there wasn't a single moment where it seemed to flag or lose its edge.<!--\n              -->From then on, all that Clorinde had to do was apply herself to learning the various rules and other ins and outs of being a Champion Duelist... whilst simultaneously taking part in all kinds of duels.<!--\n              -->Though Clorinde's reputation of being undefeatable soon became known by all, and many of her opponents would rather surrender immediately than face her, she still wasn't an official Champion Duelist.<!--\n              -->\"Your swordsmanship may well be flawless, but be that as it may, fighting a duel isn't always so simple.\" said those veteran Champion Duelists. \"You'll also need to undergo a special... or shall we say, less one-dimensional combat challenge to prove that you're up to the job.\"<!--\n              -->Though Clorinde didn't understand what this meant at the time, several days later, she was forced to take part in the first truly challenging fight of her life.<!--\n              -->Her opponent was a wealthy merchant who was known to her. This gentleman had been accused of employment abuses, not only arbitrarily cutting his laborers' wages, but completely ignoring their health. The divers he'd hired, being wracked with all sorts of unbearable illnesses, could stand it no longer — hence why they had teamed up to bring this merchant to the courts. And the verdict had already been pronounced: Guilty of exploitation, beyond a shadow of a doubt.<!--\n              -->But the merchant demanded that the trial be settled by combat, insisting that the whole affair was an unprecedented slight toward his reputation:<!--\n              -->\"Who else but I would be willing to hire these people?\"<!--\n              -->\"If I'm put away, they'll all starve to death! Kind, merciful souls, surely you do not wish to see this happen?\"<!--\n              -->\"Who among us is not afflicted by physical ailments? I myself, after spending so much time poring over accounts and other documents, have nearly lost my eyesight! I even bought them medicine, found them doctors... They just won't admit it!\"<!--\n              -->With countless articles containing these claims circulating throughout the Court of Fontaine, they soon became the talk of the town.<!--\n              -->\"Hmm... He does make a good point...\"<!--\n              -->\"Although... Hmm. Could it be that they really weren't telling the truth?\"<!--\n              -->On the day of the duel, a vast crowd of citizens — some well-meaning, others simply curious — converged upon the dueling ring. When the wealthy merchant appeared, he waved to the stands as a sign to those in his pocket. Seeing this, they began to cry out:<!--\n              -->\"This gentleman has been falsely accused! Let us not stand for such slander!\"<!--\n              -->Others muttered to those around them:<!--\n              -->\"If you ask me, there's no way those people were telling the truth...\"<!--\n              -->Beset on all sides by such shouts and murmurings, the ordinary citizens of the crowd began to waver, and like a landslide gaining momentum, before long they too had been infected by the mob mentality.<!--\n              -->\"Surely we can't just stand here and watch as a good person is unfairly persecuted?\"<!--\n              -->Hearing what the audience was saying, the young Clorinde felt lost and confused, like she'd been plunged into the depths of the ocean. She hesitated, hand resting on the pommel of her sword, unsure whether she should draw it or not.<!--\n              -->He's been tried, and the evidence was conclusive, she said to herself.<!--\n              -->But everyone seems convinced that he is in the right.<!--\n              -->The wealthy merchant had already drawn his sword, and was now walking towards her with a triumphant air.<!--\n              -->\"You can hear them, Miss Clorinde. I am a virtuous, generous, and kind-hearted man, just as they say.\"<!--\n              -->\"Without good people like me, the Court of Fontaine would cease to function.\"<!--\n              -->When the merchant raised up his sword, the gold ornamentation and the precious gems set upon its hilt gleamed brightly, bedazzling to behold. For a brief moment, Clorinde caught his gaze as it reflected off the shining body of this resplendent weapon.<!--\n              -->All she saw there was pride, arrogance, and empty bravado.<!--\n              -->In that moment, she knew that his sword-arm was no match for hers, nor could its wielder use it to persuade anyone. The sumptuous jewels with which it was encrusted were nothing more than a facade to hide his lies.<!--\n              -->It was as if a stray dog had covered itself in branches and thorns in a vain attempt to disguise itself as a vicious beast — a pathetic sham indeed.<!--\n              -->Within a split second, Clorinde had severed that magnificent sword in two, and when the sparks died out a moment later, it was clear to all that this fight was over. With this, the crowd was silenced.<!--\n              -->\"Justice revealed the truth to me, and I witnessed it with my own eyes.\"<!--\n              -->\"In this place, honor is proven by the sword alone.\"<!--\n              -->As Clorinde raised her sword and spoke these words, the merchant simply stared back at her in disbelief, beholding his own horrified expression reflected upon the Vision which — having seemingly appeared out of nowhere — now hung by her collar.<!--\n              -->\"Or did you never have the courage to fight for your honor in the first place?\""

There was naught but a distant rumble on the horizon.<!--\n              -->Zibai followed the sound and discovered three identical figures aloft in the clouds, engaged in a fierce confrontation.<!--\n              -->Amidst the clashing of their blades, she could hear, faintly, a battle cry — \"The Lord of Geo, Heaven's Star!\"<!--\n              -->Before long, the fighting ended, and the three figures merged into one, alighting before her — it was none other than her astonishing friend.<!--\n              -->This matter piqued Zibai's curiosity, and her friend did not withhold his secrets, imparting them most generously.

Understanding her mission well, the emissary began to cultivate the soil.<!--\n              -->If the soil were fertile, the flowers and plants would flourish — but if the soil were spoiled, the garden would become a putrid swamp.<!--\n              -->Flowers of joy would bloom under the fervent morning sunlight.<!--\n              -->While flowers tainted with putrescence must be uprooted with the soil, lest they profane the heavens' love.<!--\n              -->Thus Zibai's destiny flowed the course of the divine plan that had birthed her — until, that is, that fateful day...<!--\n              -->For reasons unknown, the shadow of a king, that shade of Time, placed before Zibai a crest engraved with the sigil of the moons.<!--\n              -->Its meaning was that she would no longer be just an agent of the morning stars. She would become an envoy of the moons as well.<!--\n              -->Was this, too, destined by the divine plan? So she wondered. Indeed, this was part of shaping the world.<!--\n              -->Thus, she began to travel back and forth, from the morning stars to the moons to the garden. Though she did not accept that crest.<!--\n              -->Since she did not understand how such an extraneous crest could make the divine plan any more perfect, she judged its acceptance unnecessary to her mission.<!--\n              -->But, over time, she began to realize that the will and love of the morning stars and the moons for the garden she was cultivating did not seem equal.<!--\n              -->The brilliant light of the morning stars always shone with vigor across the entire garden, not lingering on any single flower for long.<!--\n              -->They did not worry about scorching the flowers and soil that were not sacred, even if it would turn them to pure nothingness.<!--\n              -->The silver moonlight was different.

Such doubts would arise within Zibai's heart from time to time.<!--\n              -->The answer was clear — the solution lay within the riddle itself. The divine plan was, naturally, the most sacred.<!--\n              -->Yet, for some reason, Zibai's gaze followed the moonlight, lingering longer and longer on the small patch of flowers and plants she tended herself.<!--\n              -->When flowers bloomed, they were like laughter.

Sorrow washed over her, but it soon turned to unease.<!--\n              -->Indeed, her mission from the heavens did not include sorrow. So how could one born from that very mission feel such an emotion?<!--\n              -->Had she been reduced to a plant that needed guidance? Had the will and love she once bore lost their sanctity?<!--\n              -->This seemed to mark the moment that fate first went astray, only to culminate in another — the moment when the sky collapsed, and falsehoods descended.<!--\n              -->The garden turned to scorched earth, with flowers and plants teetering on the brink of collapse. The scorching heat seared her will, leaving her powerless to gather her thoughts.<!--\n              -->At that very moment, the moon-crest dropped onto her back like a falling tear.<!--\n              -->It was the same cold glow she had once beheld and turned down, yet it bestowed upon her the same tranquility and solace as it did upon the flowers and plants in the garden.<!--\n              -->In that fleeting moment of chill, she realized that before she was consumed by the scorching brilliance of the morning stars, she could still love her flowers for untold ages."

When one of them did not feel like being on duty, she would beg another to take her place, then make it up to her later with gifts of makeup and jewelry. However, so liberal were they with this ad-hoc shift-swapping business that it sometimes led to chaos. For instance, there once was a year when all three moons aligned, but this only happened because they all got the timing mixed up. And so, there came a day on which only one moon should have been on duty, but all three appeared in the sky at once. They hurried to line up in a row, two moons trying their best to hide behind the one who was supposed to be on duty... but alas, they still gave the poor people down below a most terrible fright. They burned incense for several days straight... After that incident, the sisters asked me to try to convey to the people of the world that the sight of three moons together in the sky was not an omen of impending disaster, nor a sign that regime change was nigh. Naturally, I put the question back to them, inquiring what such a phenomenon should represent to humanity. They hemmed and hawed for a while before finally saying: \"It means... It means a festival is coming, and... everyone should eat Fullmoon Cakes, and... stuff...\""

I indeed had some influence over the weather, but the bountiful harvests were entirely due to the hard work of the nation's people. How did I guide Lang-Gan? Not with any grandeur or majesty, that's for sure. Save for a few interventions to divine the future, ward off evil, and prevent disasters, I spent the majority of my time as a teacher.

Even if they are lucky enough to obtain adeptal treasures, those treasures will ultimately be their undoing if their intentions are impure.

When his seminar courses would end, he would often go along with requests for group photos.<!--\n              -->Not that he really understood them, but he agreed anyway.<!--\n              -->That was how \"Tighnari knows everything, and he's so nice to talk to!\" became a widespread saying, causing many to fight for his time. Even students from other Darshans would want to collaborate with him.<!--\n              -->This went on till one day, when his popularity also attracted the attention of the General Mahamatra Cyno—<!--\n              -->Forming factions and gathering forces... these were nothing if not the harbingers of academic corruption!<!--\n              -->Yet with some time spent observing Tighnari, Cyno found that the former had only received people out of the goodness of his heart.<!--\n              -->Tighnari himself only really had eyes for his work, and was dispassionate concerning the offers of others.<!--\n              -->Certainly he would agree to collaborate, but only in the interests of furthering his research in the best way possible.<!--\n              -->Ultimately, Cyno's judgment was as such: \"This is an upright and reliable talent who has no questionable dealings. Threat resolved.<!--\n              -->It was perhaps due to this pure impression that the General Mahamatra, known for distancing himself from scholarship and scholars alike, would let down his guard and become friends with Tighnari in the days to come.<!--\n              -->These factors would all culminate in yet another meeting with another comrade.<!--\n              -->\"This young lady's name is Collei?\"<!--\n              -->\"It's okay if you can't read or write.

    "text": "All who love research share the enjoyment of performing that research and a curiosity for the unknown.<!--\n              -->This is also true of Tighnari, and indeed, his curiosity seems to have been with him since birth.<!--\n              -->While children his age were still reading fairy tales, Tighnari was already flipping through crates and shelves in his parents' study.<!--\n              -->From his father, who studied insects, he would take general textbooks, and from his paleontologist mother, he would borrow some images of fossils.<!--\n              -->Thus did Tighnari absorb all this knowledge, whether he understood it or not, while hugging his tail.<!--\n              -->Slowly, however, he found that as his knowledge increased, the unknowns that he wished to explore also grew more numerous.<!--\n              -->For example, why were other people born without ears and tails like that of his family?<!--\n              -->Flipping through all the ancient tomes he could find in his home, Tighnari discovered a manuscript left behind by an ancestor of his that concerned \"Valuka Shuna.\"<!--\n              -->As the records claimed, Valuka Shuna were a race subject to King Deshret, and who dwelled in the vast desert, mostly possessing light-colored fur and large ears that were excellent at dissipating heat.<!--\n              -->Later, calamity would descend and destroy King Deshret's realm, with the Valuka Shuna only surviving due to the grace of the Dendro Archon, which turned their fur green.<!--\n              -->\"It is worth noting that while Valuka Shuna were noted to have been more like foxes, the meaning of their name was 'large desert dog.'\"<!--\n              -->\"According to a human friend of mine who has a very close relationship with the forest, it was a little creature known as an Aranara that gave them this name.\"<!--\n              -->\"Oh my,\" Young Tighnari thought in shock, \"so I'm a 'large desert dog!'\"<!--\n              -->To be more precise, it was the fact that his ancestors had lived alongside the Valuka Shuna that they did end up inheriting some of their traits.<!--\n              -->But of course, such technicalities were of no importance to an excited child. Thus did Tighnari immediately ask his father to bring him — the 'large desert dog' — back to the desert to have a look on his next surveying trip.<!--\n              -->Unfortunately, they met with an accident. Not a few meters into the desert, Tighnari fell into a faint from the heat and had to be rushed back to the rainforest.<!--\n              -->\"Oh no,\" Tighnari thought sadly as he convalesced in his treehouse, \"the 'large desert dogs' have devolved in my generation.\"<!--\n              -->Many years later, the ignorant child had become a reliable researcher, and this event had become a joke consigned to the past.<!--\n              -->Nowadays, Tighnari not only knows why those little Aranara gave them this name, but also why he faints easily from the desert heat.<!--\n              -->The former is simple. Foxes and dogs are, biologically speaking, both canines, so the Aranara might have viewed them as interchangeable.<!--\n              -->As for the latter, though Tighnari is loath to admit it, it probably had something to do with what his father said then as he tousled his hair.<!--\n              -->\"This lad's fur is an intensely dark shade of green. He's going to have trouble in the desert heat for sure!\""

Perhaps everyone indeed knew what the problem was, but did not want to make the speaker lose face.<!--\n              -->Or perhaps he was the only one who had noticed the problem, and his silence now would cause misinformation to spread...<!--\n              -->But Tighnari did not hesitate long before steeling himself.<!--\n              -->Though both his status and the scene were obstacles in his path, the rigor of knowledge eventually won out.<!--\n              -->After all, knowledge was like a star blazing through the night sky.

No, indeed, a joyous thing that those who studied alongside him also accorded knowledge the gravitas it deserved.<!--\n              -->But he had not yet counted on something still more fortunate and joyous to occur.<!--\n              -->When the meeting ended and Tighnari stood to leave, he heard a crisp, clear \"clink!\"<!--\n              -->—Lo and behold, a Vision rolled off his garments onto the chair below."

Or alternatively, just make Charlotte disappear.\nFor this reason, the newspaper's Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie has on numerous occasions felt the need to distance Charlotte from the Court of Fontaine by sending her off on faraway \"field reporting\" jobs, only recalling her once the Maison Gardiennage or Special Security and Surveillance Patrol had finally managed to clear things up.\nBut despite all this, neither the toil of the job itself nor the pressure of external denunciations and threats has ever  Charlotte in the slightest.\nWith her trusty companion Monsieur Verite by her side, she invariably carries out her journalistic duties with unfaltering fervor, rushing about in pursuit of all the \"truths\" out there just waiting to be discovered."

As well as The Steambird, I also looked at some other independent publications out there, which tend to be more specialized. For example, there's \"The Observer\" for celebrity gossip, \"Leisure Weekly,\" which focuses on competitive sport and other entertainment news, \"Top Chef\" for those who like to read... all the food critiques in one place, and \"Bedazzled!\" which is just sort of a glorified rumor and speculation mill.

Then, I put it all in an article and had it published in the paper. The backlash was intense. They were punished for their crimes, sure, but that didn't stop them from launching a vicious campaign of vengeance against me almost immediately. I was coming home to threat letters sitting on my bedside table on a daily basis, and we'd also find mud slung on the front door to our office... The Steambird quickly filed a report to the Gardes, and I was sent to Mondstadt to report on Genius Invokation TCG. It took a while before I could safely return to Fontaine.

A master in this art, she always manages to avoid attention.As for the wounds on her person, these are the inevitable result of her constant exposure to danger from mission to mission.Despite the curious job, Yelan herself is not very curious about the world.She eats, sleeps, and lives just like everyone else, but few things can really pique her interest.She is well-read, but she is no avid reader. She always knows what to say to achieve the best result, yet she takes no pleasure in playing mind games.She travels far and roams the lands, yet the traveling and roaming are bland to her.In Yelan's eyes, these things are not hobbies, but a means to an end.She even prefers to roll the dice to decide how she will pass the time.Just as someone who is so used to spicy food might lose the ability to enjoy ordinary dishes, Yelan finds that only spicy cuisine can bring her satisfaction.\"Blandness is synonymous with blindness, while thrills afford clarity.\"Acting upon said philosophy, she chooses an acute style of life, venturing into many places while hiding in the shadows.She dances with danger, secrets, and a strong sense of achievement — these are the vivid proof of her existence."

Only a few survived the grueling bloodshed.One of her ancestors died, while the other went insane, constituting a huge blow to her family.Yelan has always wanted to find out what happened back then. Despite her better judgment, she can't help feeling attracted to The Chasm.It almost feels like something that runs in her blood — something inexplicably ominous — has been summoning her to The Chasm.Perhaps she will plunge into that darkness one day, and the ill fate that once befell her ancestors shall find her too.The ominous calling that runs in the family shuts down her fear and turns on her craving for danger. This may be the reason for the peculiarities in her character, Yelan presumed.She had never doubted it until she came of age, until the seal on The Chasm was lifted.With the help of her companions, she unveiled the hidden past of her ancestors.That moment marked a new chapter in her life:In the past, she was a wild beast driven by pure instinct. Drawn to danger, she walked into darkness.From that moment on, she has found the true meaning of her instinct.That which hides inside her, that constant calling, is not only a source of worry but also a light of guidance.It is the blood of heroes which has been howling for 500 years.She has no fear, for the courage within her makes her strong. She craves danger, for the heir of heroes is meant for a great adventure.Some day, she will embark on the path her ancestors once took.She is the descendant of heroes, and she shall become the hero for many who will come after her."

On the other hand, as Yelan has no issue with occasionally giving herself a break, she will pretend to be a regular customer, drinking some tea and playing a few rounds of some game.Every round of finger-guessing is a tiny adventure, and every roll of dice sends sporadic thrills down her spine. Even the smallest challenge is something she can never get enough of.As an intelligence operative, Yelan takes pride in her skills — she is confident that she can read her opponents' eyes and roll the dice such that they fall outside the rules but well within her designs.If there is a draw, that could only mean one thing: Her opponents are cheating too.Don't try to reason with her. The very concept of \"reasoning\" is simply foreign to the Yanshang Teahouse, nor does it exist in Yelan's vocabulary.Be good and choose between the pain of losing and the disgrace of cheating.You want to have neither, huh?

However, the spell requires a pair of such vessels to work. Now that only one bracelet is left, it is no more than a mere accessory.However, the operation also proved a success for Yelan because her enemy did not get the upper hand, either. And this enemy of hers was no ordinary character — it was none other than \"Regrator,\" Ninth of the Fatui Harbingers.Yelan infiltrated a secret trade route that was run by Regrator behind the scenes, intercepting the goods and picking the most precious one of them as compensation for her bracelet.Now, there once existed a strange mystical beast in times of old. A robe made from its fur would be worth a fortune, and due to its rarity, such a robe is exceptionally hard to procure.In fact, the beast is so powerful that although it died centuries ago, its body remains intact today, and its fur still emits a mysterious fragrance.Regrator had intended it as an offer to the Tsaritsa, yet Yelan unexpectedly intercepted it.Not only that, she also rejected the style that Snezhnayans had chosen for their Tsaritsa — she yanked the fur off, combined it with Liyue's Ramie yarn, and made a rather fashionable sleeved mantle for herself.This series of happenings could be seen as significant or insignificant — depending on one's perspective. Ultimately, it all boils down to three words: gains and losses.The cycle of gaining and losing is a rather accurate summary of Yelan's life.None of that really bothers her though. Instead, she takes immense pleasure from it."

For the first time in her life, she stopped, for a long, long time.This state of affairs persisted until one day, when Ningguang visited her in her wood hut personally.\"You haven't been back to Liyue Harbor for a while. Something must've happened. I can understand if you want to quit.\"Ningguang stood outside the door, with a serious look on her face but her voice still casual and relaxed.\"But it's alright. I work with those I trust, and I trust those I work with. I'm willing to believe that you're here trying to find a way out. All postures, aggressive or defensive, are all means to an end, anyway.\"There was no response, but only a suffocating silence. A long time passed before Ningguang finally heard an answer from behind her:\"We both made a mistake: We shouldn't have involved ordinary folk in what we do.\"\"Ordinary folk?\"Even as Ningguang was formulating thoughts, a flash of blue shot towards her, stopping as it passed her by.In a display of great control from the archer, the arrow quickly shattered into pearls of water and broke into glistening shards of light before touching the ground.Ningguang turned around and saw Yelan walking up, a bow in hand, blood dripping down from her fingertips.One could only imagine the days and nights of grueling training in archery Yelan had gone through for all her fingers to bleed.Knowing Yelan well, Ningguang also understood that she must have been through an uncommonly tough situation. Only that could explain Yelan's uncommon determination to lock herself up for this grueling re-training.Yelan aimed at the mountain in the distance, a gesture that was also an answer to Ningguang.She released the arrow. Like lightning it shot into the skies, piercing through clouds with might that could shatter the dome of heaven itself. As if responding to the call of an unknown power, waters in the mountains growled and howled, then swirled their way upward in the form of countless arrows.When they met halfway in the sky, they exploded into a curtain of water, bringing down a squalling shower like those that adorned summer nights.As the sky cleared, there was no rainbow, no butterflies to be seen, only a faint pillar of light that fell into Yelan's palm.According to Ningguang, the Vision carries a message: \"From today onward, leave all matters to the extraordinary Yelan.\""

She works in a very methodical way. I always enjoy working with her."

Apparently, the only time that our ancestor would gain some temporary relief from his insanity was when passing by the Wangshu Inn. It must have been the comforting effect of his presence that wards off evil spirits. That said, if I ever have the honor of fighting side by side with the Conqueror of Demons, I will focus only on the mission. I cannot let myself be distracted by concerns about his status."

She doesn't seem to understand why I eat them in the way that I do, and I don't feel like trying to explain it to her, either. It's just a family tradition."

I was planning a deep-reaching investigation into the former owner of the Yanshang Teahouse, but our harbinger friend got to him first. He showed up demanding payment of his debt, and also exposed his accounting fraud, which got him thrown in jail. That made it very easy for me to take over Yanshang Teahouse myself, and it's proven to be a very useful base."
