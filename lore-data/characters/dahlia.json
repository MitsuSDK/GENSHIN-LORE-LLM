Wherever there was a thorny issue to be solved or someone in distress, he was always among the first to know and would rush to the scene to get involved.<!--\n              -->When people would praise his kind-heartedness, he would smile at their warm words. Unbeknownst to them, he was mostly just thrilled to be in the thick of the action — people's problems getting solved was merely a happy coincidence.<!--\n              -->However, Mondstadt was enjoying a long period of peace, and the everyday troubles of its citizens were insufficient to satisfy Dahlia's appetite for excitement — curbside quarrels, drinking debts, and absconded animals were far too nondescript for his tastes.<!--\n              -->And whenever something truly thrilling would arise, the elite Knights of Favonius were always on hand to swiftly restore mundane order.<!--\n              -->Thus, after returning his 19th lost cat and clearing his 30th Slime-induced key road blockage of the year, it occurred to Dahlia that he needed to inject some real turbulence into his life.<!--\n              -->When he felt the winds begin to blow, he picked a single dandelion and held it in the palm of his hand, praying to Barbatos that something new and exciting might happen to him.<!--\n              -->The dandelion seeds spiraled into the air and were carried on the wind to the plaza before the great Church of Favonius, coming to rest on the outstretched fingers of the Anemo Archon's statue.<!--\n              -->In the plaza, a bard was playing a chelys, a child was feeding the pigeons, and the denizens of Mondstadt were praying before the Archon's statue.<!--\n              -->Yet Dahlia could sense something was off amid this idyllic scene — that keen nose of his had detected the slightest whiff of trouble.<!--\n              -->There were two sisters nearby talking in hushed and solemn voices. Dahlia sidled up beside them and managed to just about catch the words \"missing\" and \"urgent.\"<!--\n              -->In line with his standard approach to \"meddling,\" he politely approached the two sisters and inquired if they needed his help.<!--\n              -->They glanced at each other uncertainly, not sure whether they should involve a layperson in their current quandary.<!--\n              -->Dahlia patted his chest reassuringly, announcing himself as a devout believer in the church and stating that there would be no greater honor than to help.<!--\n              -->Moved by his impassioned words, the sisters ultimately explained the situation — one of their fellow sisters had been missing for several days, leaving the work she had been tasked with undone.<!--\n              -->And so it was that Dahlia came to undertake this sister's work \"for the benefit of the people of Mondstadt.\""

As such, the letters were piling up.<!--\n              -->Dahlia took a deep breath and set about opening letters as though he were unwrapping candy.<!--\n              -->Like a snowdrift in a blizzard, the letters piled high around him. All the troubles that people felt unable to share with their neighbors and friends were laid bare before him on white paper snowflakes.<!--\n              -->Dahlia read each one carefully. Fortunately, most of these troubles were well within his power to solve.<!--\n              -->A young maid confessed that she had fallen for someone beyond her reach and was uncertain whether to pursue things further. Dahlia wrote in his reply: The most beautiful emotions are often those we leave obscured, yet a brave decision can sometimes bring joyful rewards. Both are fine choices, so perhaps you should let your heart decide?<!--\n              -->A merchant complained that their business was going nowhere, and they could not give their family the life they deserved.

Perhaps in time, your fortunes will change.<!--\n              -->A scholar questioned the history of Old Mondstadt. Dahlia cited records from authoritative texts and gently reminded the scholar that perhaps only Barbatos himself could help one learn the truth of the past.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->On the morning of the third day, Dahlia was still furiously scribbling at his desk when his door was gently pushed ajar to admit a tired-looking sister.

The latter involved far more than simply assisting the congregation in solving their problems — it required spending a significant amount of time on monotonous prayer and ceremony. For Dahlia, dull repetition was the greatest enemy of all.<!--\n              -->He shot up from his chair, hurriedly declaring, \"I seek no payment but the joy of helping others! Anyway... now that you're back, my work here is done!\"<!--\n              -->Rosaria made no move to stop him from leaving. She simply looked on as he fled the scene like a sudden gust of wind.<!--\n              -->Upon reading through the pile of responses left sitting on her desk, she instantly regretted allowing him to leave without first learning his address.<!--\n              -->She made a note to find out where he lived before the next time she was tasked with penning replies to the people's letters..."

As such, he decided to accompany the singer for a round or three.<!--\n              -->He gently probed, hoping to tactfully uncover the source of the bard's troubles. Was he suffering from writer's block? Had his latest work received negative reviews? Were his performances not bringing in enough money?<!--\n              -->In the end, after downing his 28th cup of apple cider, the bard joyfully shared his reason for drinking:<!--\n              -->The fruit harvest that year had been a good one, and the wine it produced tasted exceptionally sweet.

When common folk encountered trouble in their lives, they would often seek the Church's aid. Surely, that was exactly the role Dahlia wanted?<!--\n              -->He thought back to his childhood, when his mother would take him along to morning prayers. He had always found these occasions too solemn and gloomy. He would think up ways to slip away or doodle absentmindedly on the pews. If he were to join the ranks of the clergy, these rituals were certain to become a regular part of his routine.<!--\n              -->Not to mention, the thought of all those weighty tomes filled with scripture made him dizzy.<!--\n              -->Venti gave a laugh and then asked again — if there was a way to make the rituals more interesting, would he consider it then? For instance, what if he were to help transmit the Anemo Archon's guidance to his flock?<!--\n              -->Well, there was no way Dahlia was going to turn down an opportunity like that.<!--\n              -->And thus, that night, it came to pass that Dahlia became the guardian of a scarcely believable secret, while Barbatos, in turn, gained a most trustworthy herald."

This time, he claimed to be an oracle, bearing the words of Barbatos himself — words which required their help to pass on to the people.<!--\n              -->Those present were understandably unsure. There had been many cases of charlatans abusing the Archon's name to defraud the common folk, but seldom had anyone attempted to hoodwink the clergy themselves.<!--\n              -->Although, as Dahlia had a reputation for finding joy in helping others, the sisters were divided — some supported helping him while others remained unconvinced.<!--\n              -->Those who were opposed believed that should this \"oracle\" prove false, it would damage the reputation of the church. While those who were in favor felt that oracular proclamations were nothing more than suggestions — should the things they predicted not come to pass, it would be of little significance to the common folk. However, should true prophecies be ignored, great harm could potentially be done.<!--\n              -->After everyone had carefully weighed the benefits and risks, those who supported helping the \"oracle\" spread his word found themselves in the ascendancy.<!--\n              -->Therefore, Victoria noted down Dahlia's enlightened words and proclaimed them to the faithful at morning prayers. After a few days, all of his predictions were proven true — timely rains fell for several straight days after Dahlia's call to plant seeds was followed, while a ferocious storm arose on the day he had called for none to take their boats out to sea, and on the day when he decreed the hunters should hunt, their captured prey was doubled...<!--\n              -->During this time, rumors of a \"youth blessed by gods\" spread like wildfire throughout the church and the wider world.<!--\n              -->The result was that the church formally offered Dahlia the position of deacon — a position he readily accepted.<!--\n              -->On the first day that Dahlia conducted morning prayers, the Cathedral was packed to the rafters with common folk who had heard tell of his abilities.

For those who don't make it far on their journey, they hope to get turned into the strongest Dandelion Wine, bringing bold change to boring lives through the power of drunkenness... Oh, to be reborn as a Dandelion! By the grace of the Anemo Archon, may that happen to me one day."

We ended up hanging out for days after that and had loads of fun seeing how high we could bounce slimes and Jumpy Dumpty... until we blew up part of the city wall. We got spotted by the guard, Lawrence, and he reported us to Master Jean. Now she's banned me from using surprise baptism on Jumpy Dumpty. Sad times..."

So sometimes, I have to strike first. What's that girl on the bench sighing about all day? And why does that guy by the city wall always have a frown on his face? I'm always drawn in by these kinds of things. I wanna know what's going on in people's lives."

Most people hate dealing with the messy side of life, but that's because they don't see the fun in it. Here's an example: Imagine two young people have a crush on each other, and both are too shy to tell the other how they feel for fear it's not reciprocal. Maybe it's been that way for a long time. With just a little pre-planning, I can arrange it so that they just so happen to find themselves sitting next to each other during a choir performance. Both try to steal a glance at the other, they lock eyes, and start blushing... Moments like that are a huge part of the reason why I became a deacon."

All you gotta do is know Mondstadt's taverns, look out for a certain special customer, and buy him a drink on the regular. Hahaha, don't look so shocked — it's okay. Yes, I too know the Anemo Archon's secret identity, but I've never told anyone. The great Lord Barbatos successfully convinced me that keeping his secret would be the more fun choice."

                "text": "I love being a deacon, but I will admit that like any job, it can be a pain at times. The hardest part for me is figuring out how to communicate the archon's will. Whenever there's a major crisis, Barbatos's guidance is usually pretty concise and intuitive, but I have to find ways of adding in some sacred-sounding rhetoric so it comes across as more convincing and inspires people to action. Like this: \"Verily, the returning wind shall carry the dew of the heavens. O children of the Anemo Archon, have your seeds not been sown? Then be patient, and from the land where you have toiled shall spring forth blessings from on high.\" All that really means is: \"Get planting, because it's gonna rain soon.\" But obviously, the former sounds much more like the sacred words of an oracle, right? So every time I seek advice from Barbatos, I end up spending ages thinking about how to rephrase it before I can finally announce it."

I guess I just need to savor the fun aspects of life right here more often. The musical tones of the wind, the air bubbles in fine brews... and all the amazing stories you have to share."
