A young lady who sought to prepare by tightly wrapping lengths of cloth around her hand so that she would not lose her grip on the hilt of her sword. Before she knew it, the strips of cloth had been cut off one by one with pinpoint precision, and her weapon sent spinning up into the air with such ease that it resembled a sewing needle. Or those flustered \"gentlemen,\" somewhat of a recurring type, who turn up sporting all sorts of hidden gadgets from head to toe — pistolets stuffed into their hats, daggers in their shoes, powder bottles up their sleeves. Once their tricks have been spent, they end up being thrown on their backsides without exception, now facing the additional charge of \"contempt of court.\" And that's not even to mention those desperate individuals who, by leveraging all means available to them, seek to curry favor before the duel has even begun, painting themselves as victims in a vain attempt to win the people's sympathy. But this doesn't change the inevitability of their defeat in the dueling ring. After all, a sword tarnished by a sheath of lies is no use for cutting anything.<!--\n              -->But there is a benefit to the existence of this motley crew of failed scoundrels and slapstick comedians — namely, they serve as counterexamples helping the crowds recognize those others who are willing to duel with real honor, and when there is indeed some truth in the \"justice\" that they proclaim. Even if such a person ends up losing, people will listen to what they have to say — for they see that this is someone who stands firmly by their beliefs, and has the courage to draw a sword in their defense.<!--\n              -->Some say that when Miss Clorinde fights such individuals, she holds back slightly and never uses her full strength. A member of the audience, having once witnessed such a duel up close, even swore up and down that he saw the corner of Miss Clorinde's mouth curl up very slightly in what must have been approval. And surely, it is only in facing such opponents that the true meaning of the word \"duel\" is given its full expression, no?<!--\n              -->But Clorinde cares not whether the audience is moved by her duels, nor to hear the internal monologues they might inspire.<!--\n              -->As far as this Champion Duelist is concerned, the only meaning to be taken from a duel comes from facing your opponent on fair terms to determine a winner, a loser, and the righteous cause."

Yet once peace had finally been restored throughout the land, the name of the \"Marechaussee Hunters\" gradually fell into obscurity.<!--\n              -->Today, when the people of Fontaine speak of the Marechaussee Hunters, most know only of the \"Hunter's Oath,\" having heard it mentioned in some play or novel.<!--\n              -->\"From this day, I pass the candle's shadow-veil.\"<!--\n              -->\"Now, as we face the perils of the long night...\"<!--\n              -->\"I pledge to remember the oath of daylight.\"<!--\n              -->\"To enshrine tears, life, and love.\"<!--\n              -->\"Holding dawn's coming as my votive.\"<!--\n              -->\"And so shall I never despair.\"<!--\n              -->For most Fontainians, the story of the Marechaussee Hunters is now but a legend full of drama and excitement.<!--\n              -->But to Clorinde, the deeds and oaths of the Hunters are her living, breathing inheritance.<!--\n              -->The first thing she learned from her mentor, the Marechaussee Hunter Petronilla, was the swordsmanship required to slay monsters. The approach of the Hunter requires them to stay as close as possible to their prey so that they might plunge their blade into weak points with lightning-fast agility. To train her in this technique, Petronilla consigned Clorinde to a room filled with rotating pillars, each of which had been set up with many wooden swords protruding outwards, their tips covered with cloth bags.<!--\n              -->\"They might contain candy, or they might contain metallic sand. Or perhaps they'll contain all the hair I've lost while teaching you...\"<!--\n              -->\"You can chop open these bags or simply avoid them. I'll leave you to make that call.\"<!--\n              -->\"Seeing as you've already had lunch today, you might as well keep going all the way through to dinnertime. Remember, try to reserve enough strength to eat. Alright, begin!\"<!--\n              -->By undergoing such training, Clorinde not only developed the Marechaussee Hunter's skills of marksmanship, tracking, camouflage, and footwork, but also learned their method of quickly revealing their identity when encountering fellow Hunters in order to avoid accidental injury.<!--\n              -->Yet Clorinde has never mentioned the hardships she endured during her training to anyone else. After all, she is now a Champion Duelist of the Trial Court, not a Marechaussee Hunter from centuries past.<!--\n              -->She trusts that her mentor, who left without so much as saying goodbye, would understand her decision. The Marechaussee Hunters once wielded their swords to slay fierce monsters in defense of Fontaine's peace and stability. It is only natural, then, that their inheritor should do so to strike down lawless villains.<!--\n              -->Even if her mentor had objected, Clorinde would not have minded settling their debate in the time-honored fashion of the Marechaussee Hunters.<!--\n              -->After all, as Ms. Petronilla once said herself, if Clorinde could defeat her, she'd be willing to listen to the latter's dissenting opinion."

For a time, memories of mistakes he'd made in his past (some of which were not even technically mistakes...) flashed before his eyes, interspersed with frightful fragments of duels he'd witnessed. With the \"Welcome!\" he'd normally have greeted a new face with stuck in his throat, all he could do was stand there, not knowing what to say.<!--\n              -->After much consideration, just as this \"Welcome!\" was about to come out as \"Please, have mercy!\" Navia, who had followed Clorinde in, laughed and began to speak.<!--\n              -->\"My friend here has expressed an interest in experiencing the Tabletop Troupe for herself!

Well, not quite as embarrassing, at least.<!--\n              -->Namely... \"Uh!?\"<!--\n              -->He then proceeded to rush about like a headless chicken, gathering up nearly all the scripts in the store.

Presented with such expectant invitations, she said yes to them all.<!--\n              -->They were soon to find out that, regardless of which script they played, this \"new player\" invariably demonstrated an unparalleled aptitude for roleplaying. No matter how small, she never missed a single clue in the script, nor the chance to make the most of it, following up leads with precision so that the story would develop in the most natural way imaginable.<!--\n              -->On top of this, everything that Clorinde did was always completely in line with all the rules. Many of those who have played with her have come away expressing sentiments along the lines of: \"Miss Clorinde's so in control, it feels like she's a Game Master rather than another player like us!\"<!--\n              -->Hearing such things, Clorinde would only ever give a noncommittal smile in response. It's not like she could admit that the only reason she found it all so easy was that she'd been the Game Master for Navia's scripts all this time — and thanks to her friend's endless barrage of weird and wonderful ideas, had been thoroughly trained in the art of quick thinking — could she? It would be such a long, complicated thing to explain...<!--\n              -->But after having enjoyed the experience of being just a regular player, Clorinde decided to take up the mantle as Game Master once more, if for no other reason than to save the Tabletop Troupe's own, entirely blameless Game Masters from being perpetually tormented by Navia's endlessly active imagination. And for the boss, the other customers, and even Navia herself... it turned out to be a critical success!<!--\n              -->After all, no one in the room could claim to understand the meaning of \"impartiality\" better than this Champion Duelist. No bribes could sway her when she was presiding over a script — not even cake, fries, or Bulle Fruit!<!--\n              -->In the face of such temptations, she'd simply watch as the players racked their brains for a solution, then flip over the rulebook and reply: \"We've still got plenty of time. Keep thinking.\"<!--\n              -->When yet another script reached its conclusion under Clorinde's masterful guidance, a certain young Gestionnaire turned to their companions, laughed, and said:<!--\n              -->\"And to think, we all used to imagine that Miss Clorinde spent the entirety of her waking hours dealing with duel-related matters!\"<!--\n              -->As she tidied up the table, Clorinde stopped to think for a moment, then with a slight shake of her head, responded:<!--\n              -->\"I don't tend to work evenings.\""

As representatives of Fontainian law and order, Champion Duelists punish criminals who attempt to exploit its loopholes and shortcomings for personal gain. Moreover, their existence not only gives those who wish to defend their honor the chance of a fair duel, but also an opportunity to speak for themselves.<!--\n              -->But once the dust has settled and the wrongdoers have all been punished, what are those who fight for justice to do with the swords they took up in its name?<!--\n              -->Petronilla once told Clorinde the tale of a Marechaussee Hunter who became obsessed with exterminating monsters.

After a life spent hunting monsters, what purpose did his life have now that their mortal enemy had been vanquished? After giving the matter much thought, he decided to carry on living as he had, severing his connections with the Marechaussee Hunters so that he might continue hunting down monsters alone...

You'll get a glass of Bulle Fruit Juice if you can answer it correctly.\"<!--\n              -->Clorinde blinked, then with a slight hint of uncertainty in her voice, answered: \"It's... a sugar cube?\"<!--\n              -->\"So you are on the ball then...

The divers he'd hired, being wracked with all sorts of unbearable illnesses, could stand it no longer — hence why they had teamed up to bring this merchant to the courts. And the verdict had already been pronounced: Guilty of exploitation, beyond a shadow of a doubt.<!--\n              -->But the merchant demanded that the trial be settled by combat, insisting that the whole affair was an unprecedented slight toward his reputation:<!--\n              -->\"Who else but I would be willing to hire these people?\"<!--\n              -->\"If I'm put away, they'll all starve to death! Kind, merciful souls, surely you do not wish to see this happen?\"<!--\n              -->\"Who among us is not afflicted by physical ailments? I myself, after spending so much time poring over accounts and other documents, have nearly lost my eyesight! I even bought them medicine, found them doctors... They just won't admit it!\"<!--\n              -->With countless articles containing these claims circulating throughout the Court of Fontaine, they soon became the talk of the town.<!--\n              -->\"Hmm... He does make a good point...\"<!--\n              -->\"Although... Hmm. Could it be that they really weren't telling the truth?\"<!--\n              -->On the day of the duel, a vast crowd of citizens — some well-meaning, others simply curious — converged upon the dueling ring. When the wealthy merchant appeared, he waved to the stands as a sign to those in his pocket. Seeing this, they began to cry out:<!--\n              -->\"This gentleman has been falsely accused! Let us not stand for such slander!\"<!--\n              -->Others muttered to those around them:<!--\n              -->\"If you ask me, there's no way those people were telling the truth...\"<!--\n              -->Beset on all sides by such shouts and murmurings, the ordinary citizens of the crowd began to waver, and like a landslide gaining momentum, before long they too had been infected by the mob mentality.<!--\n              -->\"Surely we can't just stand here and watch as a good person is unfairly persecuted?\"<!--\n              -->Hearing what the audience was saying, the young Clorinde felt lost and confused, like she'd been plunged into the depths of the ocean. She hesitated, hand resting on the pommel of her sword, unsure whether she should draw it or not.<!--\n              -->He's been tried, and the evidence was conclusive, she said to herself.<!--\n              -->But everyone seems convinced that he is in the right.<!--\n              -->The wealthy merchant had already drawn his sword, and was now walking towards her with a triumphant air.<!--\n              -->\"You can hear them, Miss Clorinde. I am a virtuous, generous, and kind-hearted man, just as they say.\"<!--\n              -->\"Without good people like me, the Court of Fontaine would cease to function.\"<!--\n              -->When the merchant raised up his sword, the gold ornamentation and the precious gems set upon its hilt gleamed brightly, bedazzling to behold. For a brief moment, Clorinde caught his gaze as it reflected off the shining body of this resplendent weapon.<!--\n              -->All she saw there was pride, arrogance, and empty bravado.<!--\n              -->In that moment, she knew that his sword-arm was no match for hers, nor could its wielder use it to persuade anyone. The sumptuous jewels with which it was encrusted were nothing more than a facade to hide his lies.<!--\n              -->It was as if a stray dog had covered itself in branches and thorns in a vain attempt to disguise itself as a vicious beast — a pathetic sham indeed.<!--\n              -->Within a split second, Clorinde had severed that magnificent sword in two, and when the sparks died out a moment later, it was clear to all that this fight was over. With this, the crowd was silenced.<!--\n              -->\"Justice revealed the truth to me, and I witnessed it with my own eyes.\"<!--\n              -->\"In this place, honor is proven by the sword alone.\"<!--\n              -->As Clorinde raised her sword and spoke these words, the merchant simply stared back at her in disbelief, beholding his own horrified expression reflected upon the Vision which — having seemingly appeared out of nowhere — now hung by her collar.<!--\n              -->\"Or did you never have the courage to fight for your honor in the first place?\""
