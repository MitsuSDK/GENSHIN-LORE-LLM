That's all that matters.\"\nIn Natlan, where humans and Saurians live together in harmony, there have always been some who have looked askance at saurian hunters. In a land full of heroes, their practice of assessing commissions and setting a price makes the profession even more controversial.\nA cruel, ruthless, cold-blooded killer... Pragmatic, utilitarian, without so much as a hint of chivalrous decorum... In such heartless, damning terms do people describe the young man that never argues back.\nBut what of it?\nAs long as the price is right, all commissions shall be fulfilled in a satisfactory manner; all writhing, raging aberrants returned to the Night Kingdom from whence they came.\nOnce the bearer of the Turnfire name has locked onto a target, there's no looking back."

                "text": "Before he was seven, Kinich lived with his family.<!--\n              -->His father was a courier who took three days off for every one day of work, and made a pastime out of taking his day's wages to the betting tables, seeking to make far more than he wagered.<!--\n              -->If he won, he would bring Kinich a box of expensive sweets, and hand-pick lovely flowers for his wife.<!--\n              -->If he lost, he would borrow some money from a colleague to get himself drunk, all the better to cover up his utter lack of earnings or winnings.<!--\n              -->But Kinich's mother remained lucid, and would argue with him constantly while holding the little Kinich. At times, the man would admit his fault, promising to never gamble again.<!--\n              -->But other times, a kitchenware-shattering domestic war would break out, in which the victor would invariably be Kinich's father, stronger in body as he was, with his defeated mother left to quietly tend to the crops they grew in their backyard—<!--\n              -->This resilient woman was not adept at fighting, but was an excellent farmer. And just as well, too, for there were three mouths to feed in that house.<!--\n              -->Not long afterward, Kinich's father would go on to lose their house, forcing them to move to the foot of a mountain, far from their tribe.<!--\n              -->This arrangement was not without its benefits, for it did come with a larger plot of land. Here, Kinich learned to plant Grainfruit, twist castor oil plants into rope, mix tapioca flour to make thick noodles, and learn the art of trap-making to hunt for forest boars.<!--\n              -->But the ills were more evident, for any violence here had no hope of neighborly mediation, the injuries he and his mother would suffer contingent only on his father's state of drunkenness.<!--\n              -->One night, his mother snuck out and left without making the slightest noise, leaving her young son behind, perhaps for fear that her husband might pursue her to the ends of the earth otherwise.<!--\n              -->Kinich does not recall if she said goodbye to him, but nonetheless, he ably succeeded her housework, farmwork, hunting-craft, and beatings.<!--\n              -->As he grew, however, Kinich gradually found means of escape. His athleticism proved exceptional, and as he grew faster each day, his father grew less able to catch him.<!--\n              -->Each time he all but flew out the door, the wind would briefly conceal his father's enraged yells, granting him a rare moment of freedom.<!--\n              -->And perhaps fate itself had pity on him, for he was soon to experience true freedom. On his seventh birthday, for the very first time, he asked his father if he had news of his mother.<!--\n              -->No words were needed for the answer to present itself. His father pursued him, eyes shot through with hangover red, aiming to give him a piece of his mind... But long years of drinking had left the man's body with a shadow of its former strength. As the chase led them past a precipice, he lost his footing by mistake, plummeting off the cliff.<!--\n              -->By the time Kinich had reacted, the man with whom he had lived for many years lay at the bottom of a col, unmoving as a forest boar tired of struggling in a snare. He would never again get up.<!--\n              -->The first thing Kinich felt was a daze, almost like being snow-blind, before a staggering sourness knocked him out of that torpid haze.<!--\n              -->Only by squeezing his eyes shut, scrunching his nose, and breathing deeply, warping and twisting his face in the process, did he manage to hold in the tears.<!--\n              -->After some time, he knew not how long, he picked up his father's grappling hook and dragged the man's stiffened body back home.<!--\n              -->His father had never taught him how to use such equipment, but Kinich had learned just by watching in secret a few times. Now, he blitzed past one tree branch after another, the wind whizzing in his ears.<!--\n              -->On his seventh birthday, the mountains had sent him the gift of freedom — but when he opened the box, he found naught but solitude within."

Each time he came to the markets, Kinich would also go to school, in exchange for serving as the Elder's messenger whenever he was free.<!--\n              -->This trade proved satisfactory to both parties — though neither of them expected that Kinich would require but a single day to graduate."

                "text": "Elder Leik happened to be teaching the day that Kinich showed up to school as agreed. The Elder stood at the center of a circle of seated students and motioned for Kinich to find a place to sit.<!--\n              -->Kinich sat at the circle's outer edge, the other kids looking him up and down inquisitively. The Scions of the Canopy lived simply for the most part, but even amongst them, Kinich was shabbily dressed.<!--\n              -->Barefoot, he wore an ash-stained headband, a coarse handmade linen shirt, and an animal-skin skirt, making him look like a wild child indeed.<!--\n              -->\"Why don't you wear shoes?\" A young girl called out. \"Because he's a muddy monkey from the forest,\" jeered a strong-looking lad and his friends.<!--\n              -->Elder Leik immediately coughed to interrupt them and signal that class was about to start.<!--\n              -->\"Now, children, today we shall speak of our heroes and their sagas. Can anyone tell me their names?\"<!--\n              -->\"'Malipo' Burkina!\" \"Master Yupanqui!\" ... The answers rolled forth from the children in waves.<!--\n              -->\"That's right. Every one of our heroes deserves to be remembered, not only for their strength, but also for their spirit of self-sacrifice.\"<!--\n              -->At this moment, Kinich raised his hand from where he sat, furthest beyond the circle. \"Why would they want to sacrifice themselves?\"<!--\n              -->\"There is no particular why or wherefore. That is simply a virtue innate to heroes,\" the Elder replied. \"And what did this virtue get them in return?\" Kinich asked again.<!--\n              -->\"Virtue is a thing beyond price. It cannot be exchanged for anything, for it is a reward from the heavens.\"<!--\n              -->\"A reward?\" Kinich's doubts had not been assuaged. \"What sort of reward, exactly? Fame? Mora?\"<!--\n              -->\"All these, of course, but they were not the key. The key is virtue itself, for it is the basis of noble character, and that is what makes a hero a hero.\"<!--\n              -->The old scholar closed his book and gave Kinich an earnest look, though the boy had not particularly understood this statement. Instead, he was thinking back on the past—<!--\n              -->The mountains told him that the forest boar was the noblest of things, for it could fill his stomach. The next noblest was water, for without it, humans would die of thirst.<!--\n              -->But neither of these were his birthright, and that made them precious. Thus, when he gave them up, he would seek something in return.<!--\n              -->Mora was the \"something\" he preferred best, for it could be exchanged for many other things.<!--\n              -->And so he told Elder Leik, \"If I become a hero, I want to be rewarded with Mora.\"<!--\n              -->How the other children laughed then, the boy who had mocked Kinich foremost amongst them. \"Why don't you go back and swing in your trees then, selfish mud monkey?\"<!--\n              -->But his little gang was not satisfied with just this. Standing up, they squeezed Kinich out the door. Though Elder Leik tried to stop them, Kinich took the opportunity to leave all the same. He felt no need to stay there any longer, for his keen mind had caught onto a certain truth—<!--\n              -->These noisy brats in the Lodge were just that — brats. As they gathered to heap praise upon the heroes, it must have seemed to them that they had become the companions of those heroes, sharing in their nobility. But such false glory would not teach them how to fill their tummies. Once school was over, every single one of them would have to return home and be fed by their mothers.<!--\n              -->Kinich could have taught them a lesson right there, too. Laid a couple out for half a month or so, just to let them know how far they were from being heroes.<!--\n              -->But what use was there in giving out free life lessons... emphasis on \"free\"?<!--\n              -->Still, this class was not an entirely fruitless endeavor. If nothing else, he now had some answers to his doubts.<!--\n              -->He knew what he must do in the future. Become a hero — for the Mora, that is."

Some were agile, others cunning, and others fierce, and so he took their strengths and incorporated them into his own unique martial arts.<!--\n              -->As his abilities grew, Elder Leik would also guide Kinich to take on more duties within the tribe, beginning with courier work.<!--\n              -->Kinich proved skilled at this beyond even many adults, doing all that they could in half the time.<!--\n              -->With his skills, it was no surprise that people would gradually come to him, offering payment in exchange for more dangerous services, including the slaying of powerful Saurians.<!--\n              -->The Elder initially assumed that Kinich might come to ask his opinion, but not once did this happen.<!--\n              -->In this regard, the young man was like a veteran of over ten years, always able to judge the merits of any commission and negotiate suitable payment.<!--\n              -->And when there was falsehood or concealment involved in such commissions, Kinich would forcefully weigh the cost upon the scales of his heart and adjust the price accordingly, regardless of whether the other party might refuse.<!--\n              -->Such behavior, of course, led to some criticism, and there were important folk even within the tribe who felt that Kinich did not give his work enough care.<!--\n              -->But the young man would never explain himself, simply continuing to set the prices he saw fit for each assignment he was given.<!--\n              -->Even Elder Trinidad, who had charge over ritual matters, took issue with this at one point, and sought to summon the lad for questioning. However, Elder Leik stopped him.<!--\n              -->\"Come now, no need for all this fuss. The lad knows what he's doing.\"<!--\n              -->\"It's preposterous! The Scions of the Canopy have never called any such person a hero!\"<!--\n              -->\"And that's where you're mistaken. He has never been a Scion of the Canopy.

At last, his body sank to its knees. He could do no more. The final bar line had been inked.<!--\n              -->Kinich, last of the Night Warden warriors, was slain.<!--\n              -->Ajaw closed his eyes to give the fallen their due respect... only to open them to a stunning sight.<!--\n              -->Kinich's fallen form had risen, his hands, just now bloodless and white, gripping his claymore tightly.<!--\n              -->Thus did \"Kinich\" plunge into the Abyssal tide once more, his tireless blade flashing across the battlefield...<!--\n              -->Recovering from the shock, Ajaw looked closely, and lo! A heart-patterned, emerald-hued gem now hung where Kinich's chest had been pierced — though when it had appeared, he knew not.<!--\n              -->From it flowed vibrant life, driving Kinich's unconscious form on, transforming him into an indefatigable beast of instinct, tearing into the monsters until every last one was no more...<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->When Kinich next opened his eyes, he found himself back at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, people all around singing the searing Ode of Resurrection.<!--\n              -->He turned to see his comrades, bathed in streaming song, awakening one by one.<!--\n              -->\"We... won? But who...\" Kinich mumbled, grabbing at his chest. He was so sure that he had fallen before the forces of the Abyss.<!--\n              -->But someone must have intervened to grant them victory, for otherwise, the Ode would not have revived them.<!--\n              -->\"What claptrap are you spouting? You did it, you demented, hard-scrabbling, lucky little grasshopper!\" Ajaw, splayed out on the floor and clearly frustrated, threw a stone his way. \"Bah! Was gaining my succor insufficient for you? Clearly! And now you've gone and gotten a Vision... Oh, when will your body be mine to use!?\"<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->The night he was given new life, Kinich leaned back on his bed, running his fingers over his emerald Vision.<!--\n              -->Sights flashed before his eyes. The crowd swarming him, the thunderous applause, the sacred, burning Ode of Resurrection...<!--\n              -->It came to him then, out of the blue, that he had deviated from his original goal.<!--\n              -->He had struck out to become a hero for Mora's sake, but now, he fought for something far more precious.<!--\n              -->His comrades, his homeland, the laughter and joy of the people... He knew not when this process had begun. Indeed, the seeds of change may have been sown long before.<!--\n              -->\"We remember our heroes not only for their strength, but for their spirit of self-sacrifice...\"<!--\n              -->\"That is a virtue innate to heroes...\" \"For it is the basis of noble character, and that is what makes a hero a hero.\"<!--\n              -->Kinich faintly recalled Elder Leik's first lesson. He did not think himself more noble, or more self-sacrificial than he had been then.<!--\n              -->What he was, however, was surer that he was willing to pay any price to obtain what he now wanted."
