She stopped growing a long time ago, long enough that she feels like she is trapped in a dream where time has stopped.\nWhy aren't I growing taller? Am I not getting enough sleep?\nAnd just like that, the pint-sized ninja who awoke to this thought drifted off to sleep again.\nSayu firmly believes that sleep can replenish all her energy and help her grow taller. In order to live by this principle and have as much time to nap as possible, she honed her ninjutsu to perfection.\nFleeing, hiding, transforming... Sayu is the master of all ninjutsu techniques. An unsuspecting leaf or a bucket? It might be just one of Sayu's many disguises!\nAs a result, if the Shiyuumatsu-Ban needs Sayu's help, they need to commit all efforts to finding her first.\nOf course, from Sayu's point of view, this so-called \"laziness\" is just better time allocation which allows her to focus on things... like sleeping and growing taller."

She has been raised in the Shuumatsuban since she was a child, and is extremely loyal to the organization.That said, her most prominent trait is not \"loyalty\", but \"laziness.\"Lazing around is what Sayu does best. She has long mastered the various arts of ninjutsu, particularly those that help her to slack off or shirk her duties, such as escape techniques and aura concealment.People who don't know about her habits will have to make a lot of effort to find her.However, if you ask Sayu about her slacking, she will shrug and reply, \"It's not that I'm lazy, I just want to spend my time on more meaningful things.\""

Therefore, if she has the intention to hide, ordinary people absolutely cannot find her.However, even the most ingenious puzzles have answers, and even the most elusive treasures have clues for people to find them. This also holds true for Sayu.After spending enough time with Sayu, one will understand her habits and preferences. Trying to find her doesn't seem so difficult anymore.For example, if you go to Sayu's room early in the morning and lift the covers, the odds are that you will find her in bed.At noon, you can check out the trees near the shrine and who knows, you may find something unexpected.It will be more challenging to find Sayu at night, but it's a good idea to go to her house and wait for her to emerge.However, please remember not to disturb Sayu, who is busy growing taller, unless it is absolutely necessary.Even gentle rabbits bite when provoked, let alone Sayu..."

If Sayu used her ninjutsu to work hard, she would have had great accomplishments in the Shuumatsuban."

The incredible scene is comparable to an artistic performance.Thus, whenever there is a festival, Sayu will be invited by various parties to perform her mysterious ninjutsu.If it's Yoimiya who's searching for her, Sayu can still find ways to hide.But if the person in question is Lady Guuji Yae, resistance is futile for Sayu.Clone techniques do nothing to fool the Lady Guuji's sharp eyes, and aura concealment doesn't help Sayu at all in escaping from the Lady Guuji's grasp.Running for the hills is even less feasible, and might even risk angering the Lady Guuji...Fortunately, there are very few circumstances that require Lady Guuji Yae to make a personal appearance."

Once she was capable enough to defend herself, her sensei chose to leave quietly.A young animal that leaves the protection of its parents will grow up rapidly. The same is true of the sensei's expectations for Sayu.The young ninja did not disappoint her sensei. Soon after, Sayu obtained a Vision.And then, she started working diligently in the Shuumatsuban... diligently shirking her duties.Sayu is always busy sleeping and hiding from people, so in that sense, she also has a lot to do.Occasionally, when Sayu is free and alone to enjoy the moonlight, she feels lost deep inside.The people who have always been with you will one day leave...is this how life is meant to be?But perhaps someday in the future, I will also meet the person who will always be with me.Pondering the matter, the little ninja fell asleep again..."

The only way to understand what it's like is to have experienced it.This is exactly what happened to Sayu. Adept at observation and evasion, she has always understood that she is not suitable for combat.Her overly petite stature gives her no advantage in terms of strength to speak of, and her ninjutsu will not be of much use in actual combat.Yet missions do not wait for ninjas to grow fully before descending upon them. In an era of turmoil, Sayu would also find herself in trouble because of not-so-important work.Surrounded by strong foes, she had to do her best and barely managed to escape. It cost her almost everything to bring the information back safely.Exhausted and wounded, Sayu was about to faint, but only one thing lingered in her mind:\"It's not only strong brute force that can overpower everything, the weak have their own way of surviving. It's because you're weak that you can notice those unseen moments that change your fate... The chances of escaping from here are slim, but that's what my ninjutsu is for.\"The moment the leaves fell, she disappeared. All her pursuers were incredulous. The tiny ninja disappeared as if she were dust in the wind.The next morning, Sayu struggled to get up, and found that the ninja pack strapped to her leg had long since disappeared.However, a surprising object appeared in the same place instead — a Vision gleaming in the sunrise.Now, with the power of the Vision, Sayu can wield a claymore taller than herself. She no longer has to fear the omnipresent strife of a chaotic world.Unfortunately, Sayu's most immediate worries have not yet been resolved.Regarding her growing taller, it seems that even a Vision is unable to do anything about it."
