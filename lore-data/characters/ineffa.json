Perhaps even the pursuit of eternal sovereignty, or a desire to rebel against fate.\n...\nCompared to that supreme wisdom and power, this workshop is naught but a patchwork paradise, cobbled together by a lonely child.\nCompared to that magnificent destiny and design, Ineffa was created as the vessel for no such lofty expectations.\n— At least, on the eve of her reactivation, her purpose is simple: to serve as a companion."

                "text": "Regarding mechanical life forms and their \"sense of self,\" a scholar once proposed the following thought experiment: Suppose a machine's parts age and are replaced each day. In time, all of its parts will have been replaced, and none of its original components will remain. At that point, is that machine still its original \"self\"?<!--\n              -->This question never seemed to pose much of a problem for Ineffa: No matter how many times her outer shell or components were replaced, her \"core\" had always remained the same. Ineffa's core was quite literally her home.<!--\n              -->But what would happen if her core were ever dismantled in some way? Which part would represent her then? Even though Ineffa's maker did not yet possess the technological skill, she had always yearned to take apart Ineffa's core and analyze it. Though so far, through fear that she might harm Ineffa, that creator had made no such attempt.<!--\n              -->If it was the logic and memory contained within her core that defined her sense of self, then when her memory data disappeared and reappeared, like the hypothetical components being replaced in the thought experiment, would her sense of self not start to morph and become unclear?<!--\n              -->Or perhaps, Ineffa could turn to some external arbiter to define her sense of self... like the friends who stand unwavering at her side, no matter what else changes.<!--\n              -->For example, the heroic knight who would say to her: \"You are the most thorough housemaid I've ever seen... Well, at least the second!\"<!--\n              -->Or the bounty hunter who would drop by from time to time and say: \"You... are probably the best patissier in all of Nod-Krai... or, at least the best robot patissier!\"<!--\n              -->And what about the whiz-kid mechanic who created her? \"You're family! Remember to come back!\"<!--\n              -->As a result, no matter how many times she forgets or falls into confusion, Ineffa is always certain of one thing:<!--\n              -->\"I'm Ineffa, the multifunctional robot for domestic application — and I'm your friend.\""

She simply made sure Ineffa did everything she was supposed to. After all, the vendors in Nasha Town weren't about to refuse your Mora just because you happened to be a robot.<!--\n              -->Still somewhat uncertain, Ineffa made the trip to purchase food. To her surprise, after a brief moment of fear, trembling, and mild cowering, the vendors weighed and packed her goods, persuaded by the money in her hand.<!--\n              -->Vegetables in hand, Ineffa then visited the blacksmith and the grocery store, to a chorus of startled screams.<!--\n              -->When she returned to Nasha Town the next week, the vendors were talking about her in hushed voices. Yet when they saw her coming, their startled shouts were a little more subdued than the week before.<!--\n              -->By the third week, they were already able to swallow their shock and curiosity, where it was confined to their expressions alone.<!--\n              -->And by the fourth week, the tenor of the rumors swirling around Nasha Town had undergone a marvelous transformation:<!--\n              -->Her magnetic field has no effect on the readings on the scales...<!--\n              -->Her eyes and ears do nothing to tell her the true cost of goods...<!--\n              -->She seems uninterested in melting anyone over a bit of light haggling...<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->\"Why, though? I was simply performing my regular daily duties — I took no special steps to improve the quality of my social interactions.\"<!--\n              -->Again, Aino's interest in the whys of the matter went as far as a waggling of her sleeves. It was as though she never had the slightest doubt that Ineffa would meld seamlessly with the fabric of life in Nasha Town.<!--\n              -->After all, in the murky moral soup of Nod-Krai society, a well-meaning and unassuming robot might well prove more trustworthy than the average human."

Whether from searching her data banks or by analyzing the expressions on Aino's face, it was clear to her that acquiescing to this request would improve not only her mood but also the quality of her sleep. The only problem was that with her metal body's cooling properties, there was an increased risk of Aino catching a cold.<!--\n              -->\"I'm n—not c—c—cold... A—Achoo!\" Aino would insist, even while violently sneezing.<!--\n              -->\"I recommend you drink some medicine.\" Ineffa passed her a cup, somewhat helplessly. \"Don't worry, I've already added some sugar.\"<!--\n              -->Aino took the warm cup with both hands, her cheeks flushed in the heat rising from the liquid within. \"...If only you were as warm as this cup...\"<!--\n              -->That evening, after Ineffa had finally managed to soothe Aino to sleep, she retired outside the workshop, staring at her hands.<!--\n              -->The cold moonlight reflected off her metal shell, beneath which countless cogs, gears, and drive rods were spinning in concert.<!--\n              -->There were plenty of ways for this machinery to generate heat — the question was more one of maintaining a suitable temperature when not at full operational capacity.<!--\n              -->It was also important to limit acoustic energy production, which would otherwise disturb Aino's sleep. What was needed was something more subtle — something with a fine level of control...<!--\n              -->Ineffa cycled through iteration after iteration of calculations and experimentation, using herself as a test subject.<!--\n              -->After a few days under Ineffa's gentle care, Aino was almost free of her cold. Then one morning, Ineffa didn't come to wake her up.<!--\n              -->It suddenly occurred to Aino that Ineffa had been acting a little odd the last few days, and she couldn't help but worry — what if robots could catch colds too?<!--\n              -->The thought left Aino feeling uneasy, so she rolled out of bed and hurried from her workshop. But before she could call Ineffa's name, she saw her lying rigid on the ground.<!--\n              -->\"Ineffa... What's wrong!?\" Aino knelt down to gently stroke the robot's forehead, but immediately recoiled in shock. \"So hot! D—Do you have a fever?\"<!--\n              -->\"...Internal components overloaded... Attempting recovery...\" Ineffa, now unable to move, was forced to admit defeat. \"Computational error... Ideal temperature attained, but... I lack sufficient hardware to maintain this state... Requesting additional temperature control module.\"<!--\n              -->\"Of course! I'll get started tomor— no, I'll start right now! You want a cooling function upgrade, right?\" Aino didn't stop to ask why Ineffa needed to attain an \"ideal temperature,\" instead hurrying back into her workshop to work.<!--\n              -->\"No... I need something I can fine-tune, something that can maintain my current surface temperature.\" Ineffa said, staring at the sky, her body still rigid on the ground.<!--\n              -->The morning sunlight gleamed off her silvery shell, radiating the exact temperature that she had calculated as the perfect level of heat for a warm embrace."

There's no soul here!\"<!--\n              -->One day, Jahoda dropped by and, seeing that Aino was away, seized not just a handful of cake, but also the opportunity to proffer Ineffa some choice words.<!--\n              -->Ineffa collected the cake tray, her expression blank and unreadable. \"Food is not supposed to have a soul.\"<!--\n              -->\"It's a metaphor, y'dumb ironskull!

Aino installed taste sensors when she created me. I am capable of discerning the appropriate level of flavoring and adjusting the cooking procedure accordingly.\"<!--\n              -->This response only seemed to inflame Jahoda more. \"Just because it's appropriate doesn't mean it's tasty! Being able to measure exactly how sweet or salty something is doesn't guarantee that Aino's going to like it!\"<!--\n              -->Ineffa found herself at a loss for words — after all, her taste sensors were not installed to generate such subjective determinations as what is and is not \"tasty.\"<!--\n              -->After a moment to compose her thoughts, Ineffa finally responded... \"I use information gathered from Aino's feedback to model human taste preferences.\"<!--\n              -->Jahoda smiled triumphantly, as though about to reveal a winning hand in this most petty of card games. \"But you don't let Aino eat too much sweet food now, do you? So, the frequency of her feedback must be pretty low...\"<!--\n              -->Seeing Ineffa pause to think, Jahoda pressed her advantage. \"Don't you want to give Aino a neat lil' surprise? Hmph... Well, I could — with reluctance, you understand! — serve as an external sensor for a while... \"<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Later, Jahoda would go on to wax eloquent about this great victory in her diary. How she had used her superb negotiation skills to win an epic argument with the detestable ironskull and earn herself a meal ticket to all the cake she could eat.<!--\n              -->Aino would also notice Ineffa's culinary creativity soar — and how she always collected the leftover ingredients after every meal and whisked them away for some unknown purpose.<!--\n              -->This secretive and harmonious collaboration continued undisturbed for a long time, until Ineffa felt that the iteration and optimization of her culinary procedures had reached a plateau. At which point, she began looking for the next breakthrough.<!--\n              -->\"For this latest prototype, I have focused on trying to give it some of that 'soul' you mentioned.\"<!--\n              -->Gazing at Ineffa's newest offering, Jahoda did not hesitate and dug in immediately. \"See, I told you... food needs to... have a soul... Does this mean... you've seen the light?\"<!--\n              -->\"This ironskull still remembers what I said!\" Jahoda thought to herself while furiously shoveling food into her mouth. \"Hmph... I've eaten so much of her food by now, I guess it's time to quit while I'm ahead... I'll give her a few words of praise and tell her she's learned enough...\"<!--\n              -->\"I have given thought to what a 'soul' actually means.\" Ineffa suddenly blurted out, innocently. \"This word is often used to describe the vitality of living creatures. That's why I added some vitality-containing ingredients to my cake.\"<!--\n              -->\"Yes... soul... vitality of living creatures... Huh!?\" Jahoda's train of thought finally caught up with what Ineffa was saying. She felt a sudden sense of unease, but it was already too late — she could feel a strange wriggling sensation between her back teeth.<!--\n              -->She lowered her head to inspect the cake in front of her. The lizard's tail wriggling in between its sweetened layers was all she could see. And the worst part? Half of it was missing.<!--\n              -->\"...You see, a lizard's tail retains its vitality even after being removed from the main body, at least for a while. In order to ensure the freshest experience possible, I... Huh? Jahoda? ...Hmm. She appears to have fainted...\""
