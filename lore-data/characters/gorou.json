Gorou strives to ensure that the inhabitants of this island will live in safety and peace.\nOutsiders may not be able to imagine that Gorou, someone who faced thousands of enemies on the battlefield, is actually very affable and gets along with all his subordinates.\nIn Gorou's eyes, the people around him are not only his brave soldiers, they are also his beloved companions. They are like treasure to be cared for and protected. The land that sustains us, the comrades who support us, the faith that encourages us to move forward... These are the most precious things for Gorou, to whom he devotes his loyalty and courage.\nWithin Gorou exists a soul as vast and reliable as the earth."

Countless choices lay before them, but the mountain was silent.Leaderless and without any supplies, the unit was on its last legs. With their morale flagging, thoughts of surrender shrouded many minds.At this critical moment, Gorou stood up. He rejected negotiation and surrender, and instead proposed a bold plan.They would not hide any longer. Instead, he would lead the larger part of the platoon in a feigned attack to buy the others a chance to call for reinforcements. Once those reinforcements arrived, they could perform a pincer attack together.When asked what they should do if they failed, Gorou replied:\"If the enemy surrounds us any further, our options will be even more limited. The way I see it, we still have a chance, so we've got to give it all we've got.\"\"I'll take responsibility if the plan fails.\"After holding the line for several days without rest, the exhausted Gorou and his companions were finally relieved by a force led by Sangonomiya Kokomi herself.After that, he was promoted to serve as the captain of Gorgasia II, and from there he would work his way up to the rank of General."

Every time the granaries were opened, he would supervise the process strictly to prevent any unlawful deductions.And as General Gorou, he will always lead from the front.The sight of him charging at the tip of the spear is like a rallying banner, encouraging the troops behind him to continue advancing.These are all reasons why the troops greatly respect him. As with Kokomi, Gorou greatly treasures the lives of his troops, but by contrast, values his own quite little.Some who understand little of the thought process behind this occasionally joke that Gorou is a \"kid\" who doesn't seem like a general at all.But to the soldiers of Watatsumi Island, this kid is the best general they could ask for."

Perhaps then, he can take the field with even more confidence than before."

Here, readers will write about the things that trouble them and send them to Yae Publishing House, upon which Gorou will give them some suggestions.Yae Publishing House will take special care to redact any personal information revealed on the part of the write-ins or Gorou's replies, and will replace real names with pseudonyms.According to Yae Miko, she chose him because she'd heard that he often listened to his subordinates when they chatted about personal matters.The column proved to be very popular indeed, but for whatever reason, every time an editor delivers the royalties to Gorou, they might sheepishly ask:\"Ah, speaking of which, Gorou, have you heard of Ms. Hina?\"\"I've heard that she's a rather popular columnist, and a recent one, too. Is something the matter?\"\"Oh, no, no... It's nothing...\""

There is little doubt that it will accompany him through many future journeys as well."
