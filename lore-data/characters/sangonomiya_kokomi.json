                "text": "The Divine Priestess and supreme leader of Watatsumi Island\nMany believe Sangonomiya Kokomi to be an enigmatic, shrewd leader. However, she always has a quiet smile on her face, and while she gets things done in an orderly fashion, she will sometimes do so over laughter and light conversation.\nHaving read many military treatises from all over Teyvat since she was a child, Kokomi has a talent for strategy and is capable of outwitting opponents through clever stratagems. Although Watatsumi Island lacks manpower and , its people have managed to turn the tide of battle many times thanks to Kokomi's tactical prowess. Whether in battle, trade, diplomacy, or internal affairs, Kokomi will do her best. Her achievements have won her the respect of Watatsumi Island's various factions.\n\"Never fear, Her Excellency Sangonomiya is here,\" has become a popular saying amongst the people of Watatsumi Island.\nHowever, few people know that Kokomi's biggest aspiration has always been to merely be an adviser behind the scenes. Socializing with others is in fact a most tiring task for her. Her hands shake every time she gives a speech, and she entertains thoughts of retreating into herself every time work starts piling up. She enjoys herself most while holed up at home after finishing her work, face buried in her military strategy books.\nTo reach a lofty post at such a young age is considered a great achievement, but for Kokomi, the higher up one is on the mountain, the more treacherous the path.\nThe Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island.\nAll of the island's affairs are at this young lady's fingertips.\nThe desire to protect Watatsumi Island lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan. The current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess. The meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead."

This will lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan, and follows them from generation to generation.The current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess.The meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead."

The storm was approaching, and all was not at peace on Watatsumi Island.Yet all went back to business as usual not long after Kokomi ascended to her position.She was fair in distributing rewards and punishments alike, appreciated the contributions of the people, and was militarily skilled. Her many abilities quickly won the hearts of most of the people.\"Things will be alright as long as Her Excellency is here\" soon became the most widespread saying on the island."

She does not know when it started, but interacting with people eventually became tiresome to her.Having ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, Kokomi had no choice but to learn many things that she wasn't any good at before, whether it was dealing with people or performing duties that she had little interest in.However, forcing herself to do things she holds little love for is a serious drain on her energy reserves, leaving her feeling quite exhausted.As such, Kokomi set up an \"energy\" system of measurement for herself. When she does things she enjoys, her energy levels will increase, and the reverse is true when she trudges through unenjoyable slogs.When she runs out of this energy, Kokomi will temporarily put her duties as the Divine Priestess aside and resume being an ordinary homebody.Engrossing herself in the close reading of a book on military strategy, walling herself off from the rest of the world — thus does Kokomi reclaim a temporary respite from her busy existence.These moments are of utmost value to her."

Was this the role of the Divine Priestess speaking? Or was this a product of her own sense of duty? Or perhaps... it was a bit of both?As the Divine Priestess, Kokomi naturally has her own Vision. And ever since the day she looked out at the sea outside Sangonomiya Shrine, her wish has never once changed—\"I wish to protect all of Watatsumi Island and allow its people to lead happy lives.\""
