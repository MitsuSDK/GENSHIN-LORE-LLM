Need to track something or someone down? Seeking justice for heartbreak or crime? Whatever the task, the Curatorium of Secrets is sure to see it through to the client's satisfaction.\nAt first glance, the Curatorium of Secrets and the Adventurers' Guild just a few doors down may seem to have overlapping roles. However, the head of the Nod-Krai Adventurers' Guild appears to have reached an understanding with Boss Nefer, and the two are even known to collaborate.\nLook a little closer, and you'll see that the Adventurers' Guild isn't the only one working together with the Curatorium of Secrets. It seems that the Curatorium's capabilities are well recognized and people are generally more than willing to partner with them.\nThis is no surprise to the town's residents. After all, from their perspective, it's an incredibly fortunate thing to be able to work with the incredibly resourceful Boss Nefer. And the heads of those organizations are all smart people, so they would jump at an opportunity like this, that's for sure...\nAs folks stood around on the street, chatting idly, a little cat named Ashru quietly walked past behind them.\nIn his mouth, he carried a letter from the hand of Boss Nefer.\nThe intended recipient of this letter, however, was not one of those smart persons."

To her, they were nothing more than lies hastily spun by an old trickster trying to win her trust. After all, King Deshret had exiled three sycophantic courtiers to Aaru. Would it not have been all too easy for the trio, extraordinary as they nonetheless were, to come together in the time since and weave a story meant to deceive the unsuspecting?<!--\n              -->\"Will you truly refuse to believe anything?\" Thoth, inhabiting the cat’s body, asked angrily. The cat's fur bristled, not from conscious effort, but simply because cat fur naturally stands on end when they're upset.<!--\n              -->\"If a deity wishes to deceive people with their wisdom, the people will surely be deceived,\" Nefer responded with a shrug. \"So I won't believe a single word you say either.\"<!--\n              -->\"But the power you're about to give me? That's worth believing in,\" said the dispossessed desert dweller with a smile. \"Today, I own nothing, and as such, there's nothing else I can believe in.\"<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Nefer fiddled with the Moon Wheel with the slightest hint of a smile on her face.<!--\n              -->...It seemed there was a tiny bit of truth hidden somewhere in all of Thoth's lies.<!--\n              -->A moment later, she tossed this long-overdue gift into a document bag.<!--\n              -->This extraordinary item should serve as a powerful deterrent at the meeting three days down the line."
