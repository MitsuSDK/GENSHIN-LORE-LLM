Even through her sleepiness, solitude struck like an icy tide, causing her to hug her shoulders tightly.\n&mdash;That which fully awakened her was an inconspicuous yet abnormal noise that sounded within Akasha.\n\"Ah. So it was a dream within a dream...\""

She could even compose what she learned into fascinating dreams that are logical, yet beyond imagination.<!--\n              -->Such dreams are, in essence, the same as Nahida's marvelous metaphors — they all lead to a dawning understanding of the similarities between two otherwise unrelated things.<!--\n              -->But there are times when she meditates on things yet struggles to figure them out, and such incidents usually concern events related to people or society.<!--\n              -->For example, when honesty and truth could exempt a person from punishment, some people might turn silent and deceitful; and when with their beloved ones, some people would hurt others with brutal words.<!--\n              -->It feels as if the contradictions of the entire world are focused through and manifested by human beings, whose fickle emotions are perplexing to Nahida.<!--\n              -->In such moments, her metaphors would not work. Nor could she find any system in this world as a reference for such chaos.<!--\n              -->She could only explain it by the fact that the difference between every person's uniqueness creates diverse reactions when they undergo similar emotions.<!--\n              -->But this was not a satisfactory answer to Nahida. To better know human beings, plain knowledge and dogma alone would never suffice.<!--\n              -->Perhaps it was from that moment on that Nahida came to understand why \"she\" had to stand firmly by human beings' side and even made tremendous sacrifices for their sake.<!--\n              -->For each and every one of \"them\" is a unique existence in this world."

Our experience combatting the Abyss is inapplicable to Natlan for that very reason, but I still regret that I was unable to offer aid. Thankfully, the crisis has now been resolved, and Mavuika said many Natlanese are planning to visit Sumeru. I plan to welcome them with open arms!"
