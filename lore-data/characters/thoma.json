When he first arrived in Inazuma, he relied on his insight and communication skills to make friends with people in various industries.

He would be in a very happy mood when faced with a clean and tidy Yashiro Commission.Perhaps it's the sense of accomplishment that comes with cleaning. Whenever he has the chance, Thoma will pick up a broom or duster and sweep away any unsightly stains.In addition, he also takes special care of the daily lives of his colleagues around him.There was a winter when Inazuma's temperature suddenly dipped, and a guard of the Yashiro Commission accidentally caught a cold while out on patrol. A few days later, he unexpectedly received a sweater hand-knitted by Thoma.The sweater that was just the right size made the guard think back to the clothes he received from his mother every winter. Now that his mother was old, she hadn't sent him clothes for many years.With this in mind, the guard took a long leave of absence to visit his family. The day he came back, he brought Thoma a special souvenir from his hometown, and they became good friends."

Fortunately, he just drifted unconscious down the water until he got washed ashore on a beach in Inazuma.At that time, Thoma had nothing and no family with him, but still started his life in Inazuma with optimism.However, despite his best efforts, he was unable to find his father, who was supposed to be in Inazuma.But at his most difficult moment, Thoma met someone in Inazuma who was worthy of his \"loyalty\" to the end."

Otherwise, things will be difficult to handle.\"No one is sure when it started, but this saying has gone around so much that many people are convinced of this when they hear it.As for those who have had unpleasant run-ins with Thoma, the mention of him still instills fear:\"Don't be fooled by that guy!

As soon as he sees it, he recalls those hard but happy times.At that time, Thoma had yet to comprehend various cleaning techniques. Due to his lack of experience, he was often busy doing all kinds of cleaning and tidying work until late at night.Accompanying him were the moonlight above his head, the chirping of insects in the summer night, and the sound of a duster tapping on the beams.There are many different kinds of cleaning. From a simple cleaning to an all-out deep cleaning, Thoma has experienced it all.At first, he found the work boring, but after he got used to it, he found that he could think more quietly when cleaning.So to this day, Thoma often uses this duster to perform his work.While brushing away the dust in front of him, he also brushed away the fog in his head in a quiet and steady state of mind."

After breakfast, he could choose to take a relaxing stroll through the city or explore the wilderness freely.At that time, Thoma thought that people should have the happiness of living a leisurely life. Perhaps it would have been better to live a peaceful life.This calm mood disappeared the moment when he was swept into a strange country by the waves, across the ocean in a small boat.Here, he had to receive a favor to survive, and thus the thought of \"repayment\" arose.Ten years ago, when the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was losing its power.Kamisato Ayato, who was embroiled in the dispute over the succession rights of the clan due to the death of both parents, told Thoma:\"Now that the situation in Inazuma is unclear, the trouble the Kamisato Clan faces will only increase. You are someone who can see what's at stake, so if you don't want to get involved, leave early.\"Could Thoma, who had received so many favors from the Kamisato Clan, just leave like that? Choosing to leave would mean that he would have to return to his ordinary, stable life with regrets and guilt.The storm was imminent, and Thoma was like a leaf drifting in the sea.But after much deliberation, Thoma's answer was:\"If I leave at this time, I will lose my loyalty and righteousness. Father has always taught me to be a loyal and righteous man... I would like to do my best to do my part for the young master and the young lady. You will certainly need me as a helper in the path you embark on in the future.\"The will to burn for loyalty and righteousness forged a strong desire that drew the attention of the gods.As if to respond to Thoma's choice — on this night of divergent destinies, a Vision, bright red like a blaze, appeared beside him."
