                "text": "Chasca has lived alongside Qucusaurs for as long as she can remember.<!--\n              -->Initially, she believed herself to be a Saurian, though she lacked the hooked beak and sharp talons her mother and elder sister possessed, and she could not fly, nor could she leap into the crowns of trees in a single bound.<!--\n              -->Her mother loved her just as she did her own flesh and blood, and when returning from a hunt, would always ensure her daughters ate their fill first, before contenting herself with the remainder.<!--\n              -->However, Chasca was not content to remain a fledgling waiting to be fed.<!--\n              -->Once she was finally grown enough to race across slopes and bound over rivers, she would often leave the nest to watch her mother and sister hunt.<!--\n              -->She would remember how they fought, and adapt those techniques for her own use. She had no wings she could spread to fly, so she would leap amongst the treetops. She was not born with beak and claw, so she would arm herself with stones in their place.<!--\n              -->All too eager to attempt a hunt of her own, she wandered the woods until at last, her first mighty foe came forth — a foraging Forest Boar.<!--\n              -->Imitating the Qucusaurs' movements, she leaped at the boar, only to be sent spinning to the ground by its fierce charge.<!--\n              -->Rolling to her feet, she snatched up a nearby rock and hurled it, only for the boar to dodge.<!--\n              -->Ultimately, she was forced to return empty-handed, her whole body ragged, covered head to toe in injuries and abrasions.<!--\n              -->Her mother brought herbs to treat her, and her sister vigorously opposed any future forays.<!--\n              -->Chasca agreed to stay and heal in the nest, but dove into the mountains the instant her wounds closed.<!--\n              -->She shuttled between forest and stream, collecting all manner of odds and ends to use: Sharp-edged stones, sturdy sticks, sticky sap, the skins of dead animals...<!--\n              -->Her family did not quite understand the purpose of all this \"junk,\" but thought Chasca having a new hobby was a good thing nonetheless.<!--\n              -->They never imagined she would use them to fashion a new weapon — a slingshot made from sticks and skin, all the better for shooting stones both faster and further.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->The Forest Boar had a little squirrel cornered, yet what it had not realized was that it too had entered another's hunting grounds.<!--\n              -->Without warning, it found something stuck to its hooves, and it struggled in vain to get free. Then, several sharp objects, whistling through the air, struck its skull one after another. With a cry, the boar fell into a dead faint on the spot.<!--\n              -->Only then did Chasca emerge from the bush and excitedly drag her trophy back to the nest.<!--\n              -->Her mother and sister thought then that Chasca would surely become a skilled huntress — yet the way events were to unfold would far exceed their expectations once again.<!--\n              -->Chasca contemplated and discovered ever more combat techniques, as if there was always some voice in the dark guiding her on, showing her more ways to fight.<!--\n              -->But the longer she followed this voice, the less willing she became to skulk in the shadows. She became obsessed with seizing the initiative, with matching herself against bird and beast alike.<!--\n              -->Brown Deer, Flying Squirrels, Halberd-Crest Birds, each in their turn she would eagerly challenge. Rather than being a huntress skilled in the singular, fatal ambush, she was more akin to an unyielding warrior, one who sought battle and would find rest only in death.<!--\n              -->But the more addicted she became to the thrill of the fight, the less prey she would obtain — for animals tend to be the vigilant sort, and having recognized in her a formidable foe, they naturally choose to flee at the first chance.<!--\n              -->Young Chasca thus faced a quandary: the intoxication of battle, or a full stomach...<!--\n              -->And what an impossible choice that seemed to her then!"

I know I agreed to take an orphan in... but, you didn't say it was an orphaned Qucusaurus!\"<!--\n              -->Given the frequency with which Natlan faces Abyssal invasions, it was not uncommon for war orphans to be adopted, but one like Chasca, abandoned by humans and adopted by Saurians... That was the stuff of legends, and legends alone.<!--\n              -->As events would prove, Cusco had in fact underestimated the destructive might of this \"Qucusaurus.\" Qucusaurs were already well-known for doing things their own ways, but Chasca's temper would prove harder to restrain than even the proudest among that race of Saurians.<!--\n              -->\"That vulture! She's stolen meat from the warehouse — again!\"<!--\n              -->\"My house isn't your damn nesting ground, you little vulture!\"<!--\n              -->\"Damn.. the little vulture's started another fight!\"<!--\n              -->Worse still, Qucusaurs usually had some specific intention behind their actions. To obtain food perhaps, or to defend their territory... but little Chasca seemed set on kicking up trouble for its own sake. She had food far more delicious than raw meat set before her at the table, and her bed was far softer than a roost of straw, but still she would constantly stir up conflict, day and night.<!--\n              -->This really had Cusco's brows all knitted up. He had realized that this might not be some simple wildness of temper, or an inability to adapt to her new circumstances... But what was the root of it?<!--\n              -->Humans would die for money, and monsters for food, but this? This pursuit of conflict without gain, without negotiation, without anything but a desire for destruction? Only one other example sprung to mind — the Abyss.<!--\n              -->...Perhaps it was time to have a good \"talk\" with his daughter.<!--\n              -->And so, when Chasca next got herself in hot water, only barely restrained by two elite members of the flying squad, Cusco hurried over to apologize once more for not watching over her carefully enough, then rubbed his forehead in exasperation and asked:<!--\n              -->\"...Now, what do you want? If you never speak up, no one will ever understand.\"<!--\n              -->\"The hell are you even asking her for, Cusco? This vulture can't even say a single damn word! Seriously, what were you and the Elder thinking...\"<!--\n              -->Little Chasca glared venomously at the flying squad members holding her down, a growl forming in her throat, before it warped into a single hoarse \"word\":<!--\n              -->\"V... Vultures!\"<!--\n              -->...Well, that was a start, Cusco thought with a wry smile. As far as communication went, a counter-insult still counted."

This wound can only grow worse with the passing years... This is an ominous sign, and something that we have never before seen.\"<!--\n              -->The shaman sighed, thinking for a moment, before speaking again, words weighty and considered.<!--\n              -->\"...Perhaps it might be best for all if we took this chance to return her to the forest now.\"<!--\n              -->Cusco could hear the implied meaning. Dealing with Chasca was hard enough now, and she was still little now.

'now.'\"<!--\n              -->The shaman's words leapt about in the darkness like the candle's flame.<!--\n              -->Cusco looked at little Chasca.

Really!?\" The thoughts that Chuychu had just dispelled came blazing back. \"You're always like this. That's why... That's why they don't play with me anymore! That's why Mom and Dad don't spend time with me anymore!\"<!--\n              -->\"Vul... tures...\" Chasca unconsciously lowered her pointing hand, and though her mouth still repeated those words in grunts, her voice grew quieter and quieter.<!--\n              -->\"You're the worst vulture here!\"<!--\n              -->At last, the words Chuychu had hidden in her heart tore forth.<!--\n              -->Chasca's eyes widened, her lips quivering as if to say something.

She seemed much better lately... What did you all say to set her off?\" An adult who had arrived on the scene muttered.<!--\n              -->The children who had been beaten looked at one another, hesitant to speak. A moment later, someone raised their hand, and said with a trembling voice:<!--\n              -->\"We... It was just an argument at first! But then, someone said...\"<!--\n              -->\"Someone said that Uncle Cusco and his whole family... were also idiots for... keeping this vulture in our tribe... We were just joking, I swear! A—And we heard that from the adults!\"<!--\n              -->\"And they also said not to play with Chuychu... just in case her sister's sickness is contagious...\"<!--\n              -->Shocked, Chuychu whirled around, facing the direction Chasca had disappeared in.<!--\n              -->But there was nothing between the mountains save the mournful wind, giving howling voice to some cry for which there could be no words."

                "text": "The first time the Flying Captain, Elder Allpa, came forward to teach Chasca, it was because her front door had been virtually blocked up by the deluge of complaints about Chasca and the beatings she'd handed out.\nBut no matter how long Allpa spent laboring over explanations of the human world and its laws, little Chasca could never understand what was wrong with fighting.<!--\n              -->Saurians and beasts all decided things through strength. She'd won the fight, so why was she the one being questioned?<!--\n              -->Allpa would talk and gesticulate, while Chasca would study her, wondering if she might be spared the lengthy lectures if she could simply defeat the Elder.<!--\n              -->But the second time she came to give Chasca guidance, she immediately realized that there was something different about the girl's gaze.<!--\n              -->\"...Teach me. Become strong.\" With those choppy words, Chasca asked to learn human ways. \"Abyss... want to defeat.\"<!--\n              -->\"...Alright. In that case, let me teach you to use humanity's greatest weapon.\"<!--\n              -->So saying, Allpa grabbed a woven scroll, an exquisite line of small words embroidered at its head: \"Peacemaker — the Art of Communication.\"<!--\n              -->\"Our greatest weapon is our language.\"<!--\n              -->But what did flapping one's lips have to do with strength? Chasca did not quite understand.<!--\n              -->She would rather learn how to use various weapons, from bows to guns, or perhaps how to use Phlogiston, or how to shoot while in the air.<!--\n              -->If one was strong enough, talk could be dispensed with... That was how she had thought in the past, at least.<!--\n              -->But still, she had not been able to tear that voice from her heart and beat it until it stopped talking ever again.<!--\n              -->So she endured, learning every last word that Allpa taught her, chewing on that woven scroll that she never thought she would read, bit by bit, line by line.<!--\n              -->As it turned out, when she learned to communicate, coordinate, and rely on others, the efficiency of her hunts seemed to increase — just as the scroll had said.<!--\n              -->When she wrote Chuychu a letter on her birthday and wished her well, she and their parents seemed pleasantly surprised — just as the scroll had said.<!--\n              -->And when she took part in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, bearing the expectations of all on her shoulders, it seemed as if the people of the Flower-Feather Clan looked upon her with a little more respect — just as the scroll had said.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->\"Here you go. The highest possible caliber, and the greatest possible mobility... If this request had come from anyone else, from someone whose abilities I wasn't so sure of, I'd have used the materials they gave me to beat some sense into them.\"<!--\n              -->\"Thanks, Xilonen. This should make me a more persuasive mediator.\" Upon receiving the almost comically huge \"Soulsniper: Ritual Staff,\" Chasca tested its weight using the reins in her hand.<!--\n              -->\"I'll say... Who'd disagree with you after being hit with this thing, anyway? This has to be the strongest weapon I've ever made for your tribe.\"<!--\n              -->\"...No, 'a bullet has the most power when it has yet to leave the chamber.'\"<!--\n              -->As she caressed the cylinder of the gun, this analogy that Chasca had encountered in a certain woven scroll came back to her, unbidden.<!--\n              -->\"The strongest weapon, huh... Then, from this day forth, we shall be the 'Peacemakers.'\""

Long have we fought, with neither of us able to overcome the other... But come, let us end this. Approach me, embrace me... and the greatest strength shall be yours.\"<!--\n              -->As the battle wore on, the more monsters Chasca slew, the greater the hold the Abyssal power had over her, and once more, she felt her battle lust growing ever greater.<!--\n              -->Eager were her steps as she sought another target to slay, spent casings and corpses alike piled up at her feet.<!--\n              -->On that horrific battlefield, the illusion with its outstretched hand seemed almost like an envoy bringing peace.<!--\n              -->But instinct brought Chasca's gun up and level with it. This was her best chance. It was time to reduce this hateful voice to a bloody mess, once and for all.<!--\n              -->\"So you'll kill me, then? But who will understand you, who will keep you company... if not me?\"<!--\n              -->More phantasms emerged and rushed her, bringing the feelings she'd kept buried back into the open:<!--\n              -->Once, she had been dropped like a hot potato, alienated by all.<!--\n              -->She was no Saurian, but she was not \"human\" in any normal sense, either. She had a \"home,\" yet she walked a solitary path.<!--\n              -->None could understand the anxiety that seared her heart, nor put out that roaring fire.<!--\n              -->That illusion was like a vision of water after a parched travail through the desert.<!--\n              -->Could she really put an end to this endless conflict, right here and now?<!--\n              -->As she walked forward, step by step, the power of the Abyss enshrouded her, and she shivered and grew faint. Yet this feeling was also familiar, like that of an infant returning to their mother's embrace.<!--\n              -->She had once been abandoned. Was this where she had always belonged?<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->But just as she was about to touch that apparition, voices filled with warmth called out from behind her.<!--\n              -->\"Hey, Sis. Leave a note next time you leave home, alright?\"<!--\n              -->\"You're free to choose your own path in life, but remember, you'll always have a home here with us.\"<!--\n              -->(\"Why have you even come back here? You've chosen to live with humans, haven't you?\")<!--\n              -->(\"Coya's just prone to harsh words. We all miss you, really...\")<!--\n              -->Shaking her head, Chasca stopped moving.<!--\n              -->Once, she had blindly followed the voice in her heart, hungering for battle and for greater strength.<!--\n              -->Even now, it was true that she still walked alone out of habit, but she now knew the meaning of the bonds she'd forged as a \"human.\"<!--\n              -->Raising her gun once more, she took aim, and let fly with all the bullets she had in it.<!--\n              -->The phantom shattered like a mirror when struck, red ichor seeping between the shards.<!--\n              -->\"Hah, you hypocrite... You say you wish to stop fights, and yet you raise your gun to me. How pathetic.\"<!--\n              -->The apparition vanished like smoke, leaving only a hollow voice that rang in her ears.<!--\n              -->\"No. I know 'you' too well. That's why I'm sure that this is the only way to make peace between us.\"<!--\n              -->Chasca ejected the spent shell casings, and prepared to reload, only for a \"bullet\" to drop to the ground, tinkling as it did.<!--\n              -->Lowering her head, she saw that it was a Vision, shining with its own light.<!--\n              -->Picking it up, she flicked it into the air with her thumb before catching it.<!--\n              -->\"Bring it on, then.
