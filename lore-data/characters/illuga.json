                "text": "For new members joining the Lightkeepers, few things are more fortunate than having a leader like Illuga. Though Lightkeepers witness the tragic aftermath of the Wild Hunt's rampages every day, and the atmosphere in their quarters can often grow heavy and oppressive, Illuga somehow remains positive. He not only manages all tasks efficiently but also offers careful, thoughtful support to his teammates. Walking beside him, it feels as if even the lantern in your hand glows a little warmer.\nSome people wonder why someone like him hasn't chosen to work in logistics, but instead insists on going to the dangerous frontlines. Without unwavering resolve and strong inner drive, even optimistic smiles will one day be drowned by the purple-black despair. Yet whenever they hear Illuga recite the Lightkeepers' oath with conviction, such doubts vanish from their hearts &mdash; undoubtedly, beneath his gentle exterior burns a fierce, blazing fire.\nWhat are the ideals and beliefs of the Lightkeepers? This is the question newcomers ask most often, and each Lightkeeper would answer differently. Yet there is always a common thread in these answers &mdash; protection and salvation, steadfastness and unwavering resolve. They speak of a bright outcome, or a noble vision, grand and magnificent beyond measure.\nBut Illuga desires little beyond defeating the Wild Hunt, for he realizes that, in its current state, Piramida already embodies that ideal.\nOnly those who have endured the nightmare can truly grasp how precious the daylight is. What he wishes to protect is simple &mdash; the present."

They sense warmth above and stir, believing the frigid foe who shattered their stems and leaves has vanished with the passing of time — spurred by that fleeting promise, tender sprouts strain to push through the cracked earth and taste the air above.<!--\n              -->But it is all a lie — a trap woven for the unwary. A single night of early-spring frost is enough to obliterate all their efforts, leaving behind an empty wilderness — desolate, broken, barren.<!--\n              -->Spring in Nod-Krai is cunning.<!--\n              -->But if a plant can survive the recurring wind and frost — a harshness that the very earth itself seems weary of — then even the humblest Winter Icelea can find sunlight in a world reborn. It is a reward for resilience, or perhaps for courage, though the two are often intertwined.<!--\n              -->Perhaps for this reason, the Lightkeepers of Nod-Krai are known to liken themselves to Winter Iceleas. Yet those who endure the bitter cold and survive the early spring are few. And rather than a plant, Illuga — who grew up in the shadow of the lighthouse — dreams of becoming the sunlight itself.<!--\n              -->In a tale passed down among the Lightkeepers and known to few beyond, nightingales carrying burning wicks in their beaks take flight in darkest night and streak through the sky like shooting stars, the smoldering blades of grass they hold bestowing the light of day.<!--\n              -->Illuga never told Nikita that he preferred to be a nightingale rather than a Winter Icelea."

Before the port officials can inspect the manifest, the passengers are already streaming ashore.<!--\n              -->It should go without saying that customs procedures have always been little more than a formality here — Nod-Krai is a paradise for vagrants, its gates standing open to anyone who might choose to enter, regardless of wealth or status. But this time, something is different. As the customs inspector casually saunters over, a single couple still remains on board.<!--\n              -->\"Are you two waiting for someone?\"<!--\n              -->The customs inspector steps forward, wondering if the couple might perhaps have encountered some difficulty.<!--\n              -->\"Oh, no, not really. We just thought someone would need to inspect our travel documents. My dearest here was worried that if we simply upped and left, it might cause some trouble. But now you're here.\"<!--\n              -->As the husband spoke, his wife seemed to hide behind him, as though she was unaccustomed to showing her face in public.<!--\n              -->Perhaps they were a young couple struggling to make ends meet, taken in by the boundless boasts of sailors and resolved to start a new life abroad. Or perhaps she was a pampered lady, yet eloped with a penniless youth, who had boarded the passenger ship under cover of night to defy the strictures of society.<!--\n              -->Whatever the case, it hardly mattered. This was Nod-Krai, a land where no one asks about your past.<!--\n              -->With their registration complete, the customs inspector stood and watched their silhouettes fade into the distance, a faint, inexpressible feeling stirring in his chest.<!--\n              -->For ordinary people, finding a stable livelihood in Nod-Krai had once been a luxury beyond reach. Yet fortunately for this couple, these were rare times indeed. The Wild Hunt that had long haunted the region had not launched a large-scale assault in decades. The terror it once inspired lingered only as fragmented memories, diluted by time and the passing of those who had witnessed it firsthand, until it was little more than folklore whispered in local taverns. They would settle down here, perhaps build a home, perhaps even start a family. They might yet enjoy a pastoral, almost idyllic existence, one without danger or risk.<!--\n              -->But can such peaceful times ever truly endure?<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Disaster is not in the habit of issuing warnings. When Illuga awoke, all that greeted him was a sea of flames.<!--\n              -->If it truly was fire, it should have burned red. Yet what hemmed him in were curtains of obsidian black, leaping and writhing like flames. He remembered hearing of similar flames from old tales, stories told to a backdrop of wolves howling in the night — stories that had shaped his earliest nightmares.<!--\n              -->Perhaps they had not been nightmares after all. Or perhaps nightmares are simply the truths that reality refuses to speak aloud, revealed without disguise.<!--\n              -->If he had been any other child, he would probably have wept in fear. But Illuga still remembered what his mother had said when telling him the story of the black fire. He must not cry, for if he did, the monsters — seeking signs of life — would find him. Sure enough, the wailing and screaming around him soon fell silent — the monsters must have taken them all.<!--\n              -->How long that deathly stillness lasted, he could not tell. Gradually, Illuga began to hear faint, fragmented sounds stirring within the darkness, like whispers rising up from hell itself. Yet those sounds soon faded too, and in their place, the heavy rhythm of hurried footsteps, followed by spreading light.<!--\n              -->\"Poor little thing, shaking so hard... This is no place for someone so young — nothing living, only the Wild Hunt.\"<!--\n              -->\"She really was an amazing mother... for her child... A child who can survive all this is certain to grow up strong.\"<!--\n              -->Losing his parents, along with everything they owned, felt less like a tragedy to Illuga than like waking from a dream that belonged to someone else. Had he truly survived that disaster? He could no longer recall his parents' names. Perhaps the Wild Hunt had destroyed more than the place he once called home. Perhaps, in passing, it had erased his former life as well, leaving behind an emptiness that could never be filled.<!--\n              -->And yet, given enough time, even the deepest wounds will close and heal. And fortunately, this was Nod-Krai, a land where no one asks about your past."

Built around a towering lighthouse, the city stands like a lone warrior on the open plain, keeping solitary watch beneath the clear blue sky.<!--\n              -->Aside from the occasional merchant bringing much-needed supplies, the city is populated almost entirely by Lightkeepers. While there, Illuga's life was one of peace and tranquility.<!--\n              -->The man who had carried him from the ashes of his previous life was Nikita, a Lightkeeper who had recently inherited the role of Starshyna — though perhaps this description does not do justice to the task he faced, as his job was now little less than to rebuild the Lightkeepers from scratch, with only a handful of their number having survived the great battle just passed.<!--\n              -->Yet after enduring such catastrophe, the people of the Lempo Isles finally came to realize that the terrifying tales passed down by their ancestors were no mere myths. Many young men and women resolutely stepped forward, joining the ranks of those who would stand vigil through the long night.<!--\n              -->The newly recruited Lightkeepers affectionately referred to Nikita as \"Old Man,\" even though he was at most a middle-aged man marked by years of hardship. Thoughtful and perceptive, he had a knack for putting square pegs in square holes, giving each member a sense of purpose that made them feel at home.<!--\n              -->For an organization that demanded its members forsake a life of comfort to live eternally on the margins of danger — one that offered little in return but mere honor — this was nothing short of miraculous.<!--\n              -->For the time being, however, this had little to do with the young Illuga.<!--\n              -->During his first year or two in Piramida, Nikita himself looked after Illuga. He wasn't much good at teaching the finer points of everyday life — largely because he didn't know them himself — but he did teach Illuga a great deal about combat. Things like how to track the movements of wild beasts, and how to catch them off guard to deliver a fatal blow. Illuga learned quickly. When he focused on the fight before him, the nightmares no longer seemed able to trouble him.<!--\n              -->Before long, however, perhaps feeling that he was doing the children a disservice, and with military duties growing ever more pressing as the Lightkeepers' ranks swelled, Nikita decided to house the orphans of war who had sought refuge in Piramida in a separate residence and provide them with dedicated caregivers.<!--\n              -->Among these children, Illuga was the oldest, and he was able to move freely about the city on his own. The Lightkeepers were like an extended family — there were many \"uncles\" and \"aunts\" among them who cared for him as if he were their own. Yet Illuga kept a cautious distance from such kindness. Aside from helping to look after the other children, he spent most of his remaining time alone in the Lightkeepers' archives, losing himself in the dull stacks of records.<!--\n              -->Those records were filled with tales of heroes, yet not a single one ended in triumph. At the close of every entry, the same formulaic line appeared: \"This great Lightkeeper laid down their life to protect their home.\"<!--\n              -->\"Home?\" Illuga instinctively shied away from the very concept. While he had long since come to see this place as his home, he had never allowed himself to speak the word aloud, as though by refusing to acknowledge it, he might somehow deceive the world."

Only when a banquet is held in the great mead hall at the very top of the fortress do the Lightkeepers return from their postings to lend a hint of vitality to this otherwise grim stronghold.<!--\n              -->At such times, the older children will help out in the kitchens. For them, the focus of any banquet is the rare delicacies they get the invaluable chance to taste — and Illuga was no exception. The returning Lightkeepers brought ingredients from far-off lands, and under the guidance of the cooks, Illuga picked up quite a few cooking skills of his own.<!--\n              -->In accordance with the rules laid down by the Starshyna, the children were only allowed to take their seats once the adults' banquet had ended. Nikita's explanation was simple: \"Children aren't allowed to drink mead.\" A reason that could only fool a child, Illuga thought to himself — for he had already outgrown his childhood.<!--\n              -->Once, he slipped into the hall unnoticed, curious to see what delicacies they were keeping to themselves. What he found instead were grown-ups in tears over their cups, so lost in sorrow that none of them noticed his presence.<!--\n              -->Are banquets not supposed to be a cause for joy? Why did everyone seem so sad? Illuga kept those questions buried deep within his heart.<!--\n              -->Time ground slowly onward, day by day. For reasons he could not understand, the banquets became more and more frequent. Yet the adults showed no sign of cheer — if anything, their gloom only became harder to conceal.<!--\n              -->Even Illuga began to sense that something was wrong. His \"uncle\" in the records room, who would always hand him a slice of Lakkaberry Pie, did not return to his desk once winter ended. His \"aunt,\" who had taught him to bake bread in the kitchens, was suddenly replaced by an unfamiliar young man. He asked the adults about it once or twice, but the answers he received were vague and uncertain.<!--\n              -->During the fourth banquet of the year, the shortage of hands in the kitchen had grown so severe that Illuga was tasked with leading the children to prepare the appetizers. This time, he was finally able to enter the hall as the banquet began.<!--\n              -->The room was silent. Carrying a tray, Illuga saw the Lightkeepers standing in solemn rows, raising their cups toward the sky in a wordless offering. The sharp crack of porcelain shattering against the floor broke the stillness. In that instant, it all became clear to him, and tears spilled forth before he could stop them.<!--\n              -->The great mead hall at the very top of Piramida was a place where banquets were held to mark bitter, hard-won victories. The adults had painstakingly fashioned a papier-mache shell, hoping to shield the children from the cruelness of reality. Yet the unstaunched blood of that reality had seeped through all the same, unnoticed, saturating their fragile shield.<!--\n              -->Perhaps Illuga had understood it all along. He had witnessed far crueler scenes, replayed in every uninvited nightmare. He thought that by hiding in the dark, as he once had, he could keep the monsters at bay, until he noticed that the sand he clutched so tightly had never stopped slipping through his fingers.<!--\n              -->One day, that sand would run dry, just as the nightmares would eventually catch up with him. Before that day came, he had to do something — anything — to slow its flow, if only a little.<!--\n              -->And so he finally made up his mind, a strange sense of relief washing over him as he headed for Nikita's command post."

As the Starshyna, Nikita had drawn up a meticulously balanced nighttime patrol schedule for his order, doing his utmost to ensure everyone received sufficient rest and remained fit for duty.<!--\n              -->Nikita himself was no exception. He was not a man known for working himself to exhaustion, and so it should come as no surprise that he did not demand such of others.<!--\n              -->On the desk inside the command post, neatly processed reports were stacked to one side. Only a thin bundle of letters lay before Nikita. The broad-shouldered, middle-aged man braced his hands against the tabletop, his posture betraying no small measure of unease.<!--\n              -->Just then, a flicker of ghostly blue flame flashed past the wall.<!--\n              -->Nikita could hardly have failed to notice it, though he seemed long accustomed to such occurrences.<!--\n              -->\"Good to see you, Flins. Next time, I would be grateful if you used the door.\"<!--\n              -->\"I was on patrol,\" the ghostly flame replied as it took on human form, ignoring Nikita's remark.

I'm afraid you'll have to shoulder more of the burden for a while. We've taken heavy losses this year, and we're already stretched thin...\"<!--\n              -->\"If manpower is tight, then it's only right and fair that I do my part,\" Flins answered solemnly, though he had never so much as glanced at the patrol schedule. \"Has recruitment also been down recently?\"<!--\n              -->\"After such brutal fighting, many have been frightened off,\" Nikita said with a bitter smile. \"They were all young, with bright futures ahead of them. Yet I had no choice but to send them to the battlefield.\"<!--\n              -->\"Maybe this is the burden a Starshyna must bear.\" It was unclear whether Flins meant this as consolation or merely a statement of fact.

I remember him — the child you rescued from the ashes.\"<!--\n              -->\"I didn't save those children just to raise them into soldiers... He deserves a better future — not to die on some battlefield.\"<!--\n              -->\"But you do require his aid, do you not?\" Flins countered. \"Does he have skills?\"<!--\n              -->\"His combat skills are almost flawless. When he faces monsters, he hardly seems like a child at all.\"<!--\n              -->\"You were his teacher?\"<!--\n              -->Nikita fell silent.<!--\n              -->After a long pause, he let out a deep sigh. \"...I should've found him a good home, let him start anew, rather than keeping him here in this castle, following the same path I did. But you've met the people in Nasha Town... You can never be sure who they really are beneath the surface. How could I be sure I was leaving him with good people, and not someone whose true motives were hidden behind a harmless smile...?\"<!--\n              -->\"The dawn approaches. I should take my leave.\" Flins knew that the answer Nikita sought already lay within his heart. Rising, he returned the letter to the desk and departed from the command post.<!--\n              -->This time, he left through the door.<!--\n              -->Seeing someone emerge, Illuga, who had been waiting outside the command post, felt a twinge of confusion. When had the man entered? Could it be that Illuga had dozed off while waiting and missed him?<!--\n              -->Before he could open his mouth, the approaching Lightkeeper spoke.<!--\n              -->\"Go inside. The old man is waiting for you.\" And with that, he vanished into the night.<!--\n              -->In the eastern sky, the morning stars had already risen.

In the end, though, he remained in the logistics squad, trusting that the old man had good reason for placing him there.<!--\n              -->At least one thing was different — he could finally open his heart to the world.

After all, he was a Lightkeeper now — surely it was only natural to view his colleagues as family?<!--\n              -->Logistics work involves many varied tasks — organizing supplies, collating reports, delivering messages, the list goes on.

Are you here to pay your respects as well?\"<!--\n              -->This Ratnik stationed on a lonely island no longer belonged to any active squad. His seniority among the Lightkeepers seemed to rival even Nikita's, and Illuga suspected that he, too, carried an unspoken history of grief — one shrouded in the same veil of mystery as the man himself.<!--\n              -->\"My old comrades rest elsewhere — this place was built to house those who fell in the last decade or so. The old man asked me to see if anything here needed repair. I spend most of my time around graves, after all — I've become something of an expert.\"<!--\n              -->Nikita had also asked him to keep an eye on the melancholy young Illuga, but Flins left that part unspoken.<!--\n              -->Illuga had a sense that perhaps he should share his troubles with Flins. Someone who had survived as many battles as he might be able to dispel his doubts. Yet Illuga couldn't put his troubles into words. Perhaps he only needed an opportunity — a chance to confirm the answer he already carried in his heart.<!--\n              -->\"Mr. Flins, in your opinion, which is more unforgivable of a Lightkeeper — recklessness, or cowardice?\"<!--\n              -->\"I'm afraid the premise of your question is misguided. To join the Lightkeepers is itself a testament to courage. And as a steadfast, upright Lightkeeper — what reason would you have to doubt your choices derive from a sense of justice?\"<!--\n              -->After returning from the cemetery, Illuga submitted his request to assume command of the investigation squad. Ivar's injuries meant he could no longer fight, so in truth, Illuga now WAS the squad.<!--\n              -->Unlike with his request to join the Lightkeepers, this time he received a swift response. His appointment letter was heavier than he had expected, and when he opened it, a gleaming gemstone fell out. He had seen such a stone in Flins's possession, but only now did he believe the stories that had once seemed so implausible.<!--\n              -->This was indeed a gift from the world. The gemstone weighed heavy in his palm, much like the responsibility he was about to shoulder."

How exactly was I trying to fix it, you ask? Hah, well, if you must know, it was a trick I learned from my old pops.

It spooked him so bad that now, the second he hears her voice, he bolts for my lamp.
