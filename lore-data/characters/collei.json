Positive and optimistic, enthusiastic and kind.\nCollei is from Sumeru, but few people know about her experiences before she came to Gandharva Ville, and she herself never mentions anything about her past.\nPerhaps because of Collei's pure gaze and earnest attitude, people saw her reserved demeanor as just part of her personality and did not shy away from her because of it.\nThe children of Gandharva Ville love to watch her sew dolls, and those who find themselves lost in Avidya Forest are willing to follow her back to safety.\nSince her return to Sumeru, Collei has earned the trust and respect of the people with her actions.\nBut at night, when everything is dark, she sometimes thinks about those memories that she has buried away.\nEven though everything is going well, she still hopes that she can work even harder and improve faster in the future.\n&mdash;Only in this way can she overcome her past weak self as quickly as possible."

                "text": "If words are the vehicles of wisdom, being literate is undoubtedly the starting point of the pursuit of knowledge. Collei, however, seems to have only barely reached the foot of the mountain of knowledge.<!--\n              -->When she first arrived in Gandharva Ville, even the outspoken Tighnari showed obvious hesitation, making repeated inquiries with the General Mahamatra if she had walked through the wrong door, since he had yet to make any plans to teach preschool level courses.<!--\n              -->Still, after several twists and turns, Collei did finally become a trainee. To facilitate her learning of words, Tighnari gathered a wide assortment of books and documents, in the hope that Collei would soon master enough words through extensive reading.<!--\n              -->Apart from the literacy encyclopedias for children and the mandatory-reading academic papers that made her head swell, Collei can most often be found reading fairy tale picture books from Mondstadt.<!--\n              -->The logic is simple: those books tend to have fewer words and more pictures. Even if you do not know the words, chances are that you can still guess their meaning by looking at the illustrations.<!--\n              -->However, reading only children's books hardly sufficed to keep up with her curriculum. Once she had picked up slightly more words, she immediately started to look for new extracurricular reading materials.<!--\n              -->According to some travelers who had passed through Avidya Forest, there was a type of book in Inazuma known as the \"light novel,\" which was easier to read than academic papers, and with fewer illustrations than picture books. To Collei, that sounded like the exact type of book she needed.<!--\n              -->More importantly, the plots of these \"light novels\" were often so incredibly riveting that as soon as they got a copy, many readers just had to finish reading it in one go, even if they had to stay up all night.<!--\n              -->That definitely sounded tempting to Collei, since she had to force herself, more often than not, to stay awake long enough to finish her readings.<!--\n              -->One day after her forest patrol, Collei excitedly ran back to her dormitory with the newest volume of \"Onibudou.\" She was so ready to pull an all-nighter reading the light novel — and as it turned out, she indeed stayed awake that night.<!--\n              -->\"My sealed power!\" \"The lonesome avenger!\" \"You'd be wise to stay away from me!\" \"I shall never witness the grace of the gods!\"...<!--\n              -->—Covering her head with the quilt, Collei tossed and turned upon her mattress the entire night.

How am I supposed to tell Amber about this...\"<!--\n              -->Plus, she would have to ask her master to write the letter for her.

Talking to Aranara about my problems... I mean, I've read about it in the books, but they were children's books! I'm sure I've outgrown that... But now that there's no one around...\"<!--\n              -->Before she knew it, she was already crouching in said hollow.<!--\n              -->The darkness turned into a solid fortress, isolating Collei from all kinds of pressure.<!--\n              -->Collei, being an introvert by nature, found it difficult to present herself impeccably. No matter how hard she strove to be as outgoing and sunny as Amber, she could never manage to ignore her weariness and loneliness.<!--\n              -->Thus did Collei vent her distress to that hollow, emptying herself of all the negativity she had accumulated after getting back to Sumeru.<!--\n              -->\"Did Collei go on patrol in that area again?\"<!--\n              -->A few days later, Tighnari checked on Collei's recent forest patrol routes, which she had been taking all too frequently, before looking at her test papers, which featured remarkably higher scores. He could not help but think to himself:<!--\n              -->\"Did she find a way to improve her grades in the forest? Well, that's not bad either way. Alright, I'll save that patrol route for her and leave her be for the time being. I'll have other Rangers take the other routes.\""

Yet, they could still hear the beast roaring from not too far off.<!--\n              -->Perhaps it was because of the narrow passage, if not for other reasons, but her only remaining companion bumped into her, sending her careening off the cliff.<!--\n              -->Fortunately, Collei managed to grab a tiny twig in her panic, before stretching out her other hand and shouting for help.<!--\n              -->However, that companion merely glanced at her with a complicated look before escaping alone without hesitation.<!--\n              -->She did not get far, the beast's howls outpacing her fleeing steps like a raging wind. The beast's pure predatory instinct caused it to overlook the shivering Collei, who was barely hanging onto the cliff.<!--\n              -->Collei quietly withdrew her hand and held on tightly to the branch that might break at any moment, until all the sounds above her head died down.<!--\n              -->The roar of the beast and the screams of that companion had all disappeared.<!--\n              -->She could not hate that companion.

No matter how well they could play these most childish games, what use were they in hunting game out in the wild?<!--\n              -->Yet, the girl with her was extremely passionate about these little games.

If not for the rewards, why would anyone participate in these activities?

I hit it!\" Collei turned her head excitedly. \"Hey!

Oh, there was a time when I accidentally saw her research journal — only for a second, though. It was all written in old script, and I couldn't even make out half of it... Definitely the scariest book in Teyvat!"
