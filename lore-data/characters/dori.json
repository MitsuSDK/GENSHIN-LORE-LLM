It wasn't long before she encountered a Fog Div. Just as the Fog Div was about to eat her alive, she said in a panic, \"Wait, Mr. Fog Div! Don't eat me! I've got a story to tell you. Please, have a listen, and if you like what you hear, then perhaps you would spare me...\""

Just as she was beginning to feel helpless, she happened to find a magic lamp in her warehouse. She began to polish the lamp, when all of a sudden, a puff of red smoke came out. The smoke spoke to her and claimed to be The Genie of Beauty and Kindness. The merchant somehow reminded the genie of her own lovely daughter, so she kindly offered to grant the merchant a wish."

The merchant praised the Fog Div's potential, saying that it, too, would surely gain the genie's great power if only it were to stay in the same magic lamp. The Fog Div agreed and entered the merchant's magic lamp... Huh? Is this a real story? Backstory details cost extra! Give me another 990,000 Mora and I'll tell you!"
