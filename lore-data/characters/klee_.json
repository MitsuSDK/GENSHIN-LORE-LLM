As an official member of the Knights of Favonius, her strength in combat cannot be underestimated.As a hyperactive child, meanwhile, her destructive capabilities cannot be overstated.After all, while other Mondstadt children her age are still playing with regular toys, Klee's favorite toys are... live explosives."

They entrusted Klee to the care of Albedo and the Knights of Favonius.Though still small, Klee knew she would one day become just like her mother.One day, her explosives would become something that her mother would be proud of."
