He continues to adventure with as much enthusiasm as he did on his very first outing, bettering himself despite his relentless bad luck.\nFischl's raven Oz compliments Bennett on his robust nature, whilst the boy's combat style, which shows a complete disregard for his own safety, has always fascinated Varka. Even Barbara, who comes across injuries on a regular basis, is surprised by how often he comes in injured or needing another dislocation popped back into place.\nBennett simply treats his own bad luck as just another stepping stone on his way to becoming a grand adventurer.\nBennett knows in his heart that this is the right attitude for the great adventurers of the future."

The event seemed to have left him with a broken heart.Another member, Royce, heard someone shout \"Heyo!\" before losing consciousness in a huge explosion. The culprit, Klee, was sent to the confinement room for seven days for mistaking the cave the adventurers were still exploring in for a giant rabbit hole and blowing it up.Heckler suffered from a severe bout of diarrhea for a week after joining the team. Although it turned out to be food poisoning, he insisted it was because of Bennett's bad luck.\"They'll be back! They're just... on leave.

But how could he explain that which lay before him?In that moment, it hit him, and he believed it to be true.\"This baby must be... a child abandoned by the world itself.\"Though there were no mighty artifacts, jewelry, or gold, the old man's face did not seem disappointed in the slightest, for he regarded this baby, whose life hung by a mere thread, to be his treasure.\"This child is what I was meant to find on this journey,\" he thought as he took the baby into his arms.Even if what he was about to do opposed the will of the world itself, he was unafraid."

Where are the undergarments I bought you?\" \"Dad, it's raining, better keep your distance from me so you don't get struck by lightning!\"Taking care of all his aging dads who have no family has taken up most of his time outside of adventuring.\"The dads certainly have found a treasure, haha!\"Cyrus, the current Guild Master, laughed, giving Bennett a pat on the back.Though he is unlucky himself, he can at least try to bring luck to those he cares about.

Doesn't that hurt?\" Grand Master Varka of the Knights was extremely intrigued after seeing Bennett in combat.It's not that Bennett doesn't feel pain — he has simply gotten used to it. He adapted to the pain as others would to pungent smells or blinding light.Therefore, the way Bennett dives into battles head-on without reservation has become a signature of his."

Once over, their souls are brought back to their homeland by Barbatos.He once feared death.However, after pondering on this matter some more, he now feels death may be something fortunate for an adventurer...Not that fortune has anything to do with him.\"Onto the next treasure!\" And with that, Bennett puts this thinking business behind him."

He sticks those bandages on his wounds with the care of one pinning a medal to their chest, before thanking her wholeheartedly.Bennett keeps many such bandages in his utility pouch when he goes on adventures. Ones he gets from his dads, from Barbara, from Katheryne... and from adventurers he sometimes meets by chance after getting injured.These tiny tokens of goodwill form a tangible collection of fair fortune unique to Bennett.\"Well, since everyone's by my side, I guess I'm not that unlucky after all.\""

I... don't mind...\"At last, his tightly-wound emotions came loose, allowing his many injuries to rob him of his consciousness, and he collapsed.When he reawakened, he found that his wounds had been cauterized by a mysterious flame, stopping both the bleeding and the pain.A jewel pulsed warmly in the palm of his hand, its rhythm in time with the heartbeat in his chest — the beating heart of an adventurer.This was not the mercy of the world, or that fate took pity on him.
