Be it experimentation or dissertation, this type of person always makes whatever they're doing look easy.<!--\n              -->The other kind of person wears their woes on their faces. Sighs spill from their lips as mournful notes while they clutch their tools, looking lost. Intermittently, they will jot something down before slashing it out, battling themselves all the way.<!--\n              -->Layla belongs to the latter category.<!--\n              -->Being poor of health and bereft of sleep is not uncommon among researchers, but Layla takes it to a whole other level. The bags of exhaustion hanging beneath her eyes and weariness burned across her features make it impossible for her to hide the stress gnawing at her.<!--\n              -->Should someone approach her, they will often hear her whispering things like \"I don't understand,\" or \"why,\" and even whimpering \"I'm doomed.\" These lamentations often earn her looks of sympathy.<!--\n              -->The halls of Akademiya exist not just as the altar of knowledge to dedicated students but also as the source of their nightmares. Countless among their number have suffered failed experiments and watched their dissertations get torn apart. Rumor has it that, unable to bear the rigors and pressures of school, many students each year choose to depart before they graduate, quitting before their journey is complete.<!--\n              -->At first glance, Layla might seem like she hangs on the edge of departing herself, but in actuality, she has already outlasted several classmates who enrolled in the same year as her.<!--\n              -->When seeking knowledge, talent is useful, but perseverance is essential."

                "text": "The reasons behind Layla's poor physical health and insomnia can be traced back to a single factor: academic pressure.<!--\n              -->All students of the Darshans are required to commit to their studies, complete their essays, and pass their examinations or dissertations. Though this task sounds simple, simple does not mean easy, and the investment demanded of students comes in the form of time and effort.<!--\n              -->Unfortunately for Layla, she is always slower at finishing her papers than her peers.<!--\n              -->She often spends a great deal of time contemplating, and worrying about the validity of her theses. Is the content overly simplistic compared to that written by her classmates? Are her calculations truly accurate? And if so, are they as concise as they can be?<!--\n              -->She feels that, as a student of a most prestigious Darshan, she cannot slack in her studies. But at the same time, she dares not commit to her writings in haste.<!--\n              -->Seized by hesitation, time often slips from between her fingers, and leaves her staring at the blank pages of her work without having written a word.<!--\n              -->Because of this, she often finds herself working through the night, and leaving sleep for the day. Yet, with the breaking of dawn, she often finds herself assailed by new assignments, causing her to descend into a vicious spiral.<!--\n              -->As such, her habits have afflicted her body with abnormal side effects.<!--\n              -->Now, she often rises at night, wandering. Upon waking, she often finds herself unable to remember what she had done or where she had gone — the rumored symptoms of the phenomenon known as \"sleepwalking,\" described by her peers.<!--\n              -->From how her classmates have described her sleepwalking, it is as if she suddenly manifests with neither hint nor reason in a certain place. Mysteriously, none of them have been able to fully explain where she goes after or what she does either.<!--\n              -->Besides sleepwalking, she has also discovered another strange recurrence in her life.<!--\n              -->Each time she awakes from sleepwalking, she finds her unwritten papers from the day before fully completed, meticulous and accurate calculations included! Even the handwriting appears to be hers.<!--\n              -->Stranger still, the author of her papers also has a habit of viciously critiquing the arguments and experimental methods of others.<!--\n              -->Layla simply could not fathom herself committing these acts, and found herself suspecting that someone was messing with her.<!--\n              -->However, upon recalling her experiences leading from her home to the halls of the Darshan, she could think of no one with proper motive.<!--\n              -->The term \"Heaven-Sent Thesis\" is often used in Sumeru to describe an impossible miracle... and if what Layla had been experiencing did not count as a \"Heaven-Sent Thesis,\" she didn't know what did.<!--\n              -->Did a miracle truly grace her? Did the stars themselves, moved by her dedication to the study, repay her with a blessing?<!--\n              -->Regardless, \"The Stars' Blessing\" has solved several of her woes. Now, the papers she needs to write for several classes can be handed in without additional worry on her end.<!--\n              -->As for the other details, well, that is probably best left for when she had the energy to care.

Upon his stall, he separated colorful pages worth varying rewards into wooden boxes. In a display of astonishing speed and agility, the owner would shift these boxes about and shuttle them from position to position. Afterward, he would ask those participating in his lottery to pick a box.<!--\n              -->Despite not managing to claim the grand prize during her first few attempts, after a few more tries, Layla began to notice a pattern.<!--\n              -->Though the stall owner possessed blinding hand speed, she realized that his left thumb barely moved during the shuffling process.<!--\n              -->Hence, she realized the box nearest to his left them would experience the least amount of deviations to its position.<!--\n              -->After achieving such comprehension, Layla managed to repeatedly win the grand prize. When the curious stall owner discovered how Layla used her insight to peer beyond the mirage of his speed, he found himself overcome with admiration for the girl and offered her a generous bonus reward.<!--\n              -->For Layla, the reward was a thing of secondary importance. The true pleasure she got was getting to behold the awesome skills that other people possessed.<!--\n              -->Unlike the conservatives in the Akademiya, she did not look down upon the arts and trades of those who worked in the streets.

When faced with simple questions, she could calculate the answers in a blink of an eye without even needing to do the equations in written form.<!--\n              -->Before ever entering the halls of Akademiya, Layla had a chance encounter with her future mentor.

For example, her habit of fixating on problems afflicted her with a great deal of indecisiveness.<!--\n              -->Moreover, her ability to socialize was also lacking. When involved in discussions, she often struck others as aloof and arrogant due to her reluctance in expressing her views, which led to her having few friends in the Darshan.<!--\n              -->What diminished her confidence even further was the fact that among the many papers she has submitted, few were actually written by her.

One time, however, she broke the norm and found herself engaged in a heated debate.<!--\n              -->During a discussion for a class on Theoretical Astrology, an esteemed Herbad skimmed over Layla and her classmates' papers, and then began to harshly criticize some of Layla's arguments.<!--\n              -->In the opinion of the Herbad, Theoretical Astrology is a sacred field of study with laws and theories that have been long crystallized by the expertise of countless researchers across the ages and cemented irrefutably by generations of testing and calculations. For Layla to question and even dare to correct some of these pre-accepted notions was tantamount to blasphemy.<!--\n              -->Layla did not respond to the criticism in the heat of the moment, however.

In one respect, failing to get a passing score for their seminar report will result in major negative effects on their finals.<!--\n              -->Furthermore, it was most presumptuous for a student to argue matters of academic validity with a Herbad, for any Herbad was far more refined than a mere student, whether it be in terms of knowledge and seniority, after all.<!--\n              -->Perhaps the arguments Layla made questioning long-accepted doctrine were simply results of a miscalculation on her part, and she might have been humiliated in the end on account of being mistaken.<!--\n              -->Even so, she did not give up. She continued her discourse with the Herbad using her reports. Then, with the passing of half a year, the Herbad went to find Layla once more.

Layla, in her persistence, had reminded him, at length, of this pursuit of enlightenment.<!--\n              -->After the conclusion of the seminars, as Layla was going through the bag that held the documents she had accrued during her exchanges with the Herbad, she spontaneously discovered a gleaming Vision in the bag's depths.<!--\n              -->It lay there upon a thick stack of notes, like a fallen star pressed into the pages."
