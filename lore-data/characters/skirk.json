He cut the meat from its legs, skewered the chunks using his weapon, and cooked them over the open fire. At last, he stood up — something he seldom did — and shoved the meat between her teeth. Bland as it was, the oiliness of the fat was more than a feast for the starving girl.<!--\n              --><!--\n              -->At the very least, he didn't ask her to feed herself.

They'd be sweating buckets inside a cold, dark cave, but shiver uncontrollably under the blazing sun. So different from all the other creatures around them, and yet they lived quite happily. That's the miracle of life — unfathomably complex, but at the same time so simple.\n\n|vo_09_01_title      = About Surtalogi"

Instead, they allow the laws of nature to take precedence over their own emotions. In her own words, \"some call this being a callous observer, but I think it's merciful at the same time.\""

Ended up destroying quite a few instruments that way. After that, I figured I might as well build my own since I clearly needed something more robust. So I gathered some strong materials and built a few instruments from memory. Oh, here, take one.
