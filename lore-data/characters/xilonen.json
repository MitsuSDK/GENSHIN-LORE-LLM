Is that how Name Engravers gain their power!?\"<!--\n              -->When a gaggle of curious young Children of Echoes finally managed to track down Xilonen, the current Name Engraver, who'd hidden herself away in the treetops for an afternoon nap, she yawned and replied in a tone of resignation:<!--\n              -->\"First of all, forging Ancient Names is a matter of technique.\"<!--\n              -->\"Huh? But...\"<!--\n              -->\"Meaning that the key is to study hard, then put what you've learned into practice.\"<!--\n              -->But before she could even finish imparting her words of wisdom, the children had already scampered off, wearing dissatisfied pouts. Their wild yet simple imaginings had been disappointed, dropping to the ground like a balloon weighed down by a basket of obsidian. Until another such idea occurred to them, reviving their fantasies and carrying them off into the clouds, they would continue to learn — whether willingly or not.<!--\n              -->\"Heh, it's not like I was lying...\"<!--\n              -->The Name Engraver lay back down, shaded from the sunlight by a canopy of lush vegetation. This was the perfect place for a nap, and the next half an hour or so would be more than enough for her to recharge, ready to tackle the heavy tasks that awaited her.<!--\n              -->\"The only way anyone can ever hope to make those stories come true is by studying their tail off first...\""

One by one, they would lean forward onto their desks and drift off to dreamland.<!--\n              -->Eventually, Xilonen would be the only student still awake. Under her tutor's approving gaze, she would even raise the notebook she was holding and ask questions of her own.<!--\n              -->\"Do Phlogiston Engravings rely on phlogiston flow to operate? If I were to dive into a pool of pure phlogiston, would the engraving diagrams on my body activate, shut down, or blow up?\"<!--\n              -->\"Does phlogiston exist in a gaseous state? If so, then imagine I were to fill a chimney with it and drop a piece of meat from the top — how tall would the chimney have to be, and how dense the phlogiston, for the meat to be fully cooked at the exact time it reached the bottom?\"<!--\n              -->\"If losing about 20% of their body fluids can have life-threatening consequences for humans, then how much phlogiston would a Candlecap Mushroom need to lose before it withered or lost its heat?\"<!--\n              -->Though these questions may strike some as incisive, even slightly peculiar, they did not annoy Teyiz, the renowned Name Engraver, who did not think in the slightest that Xilonen was asking them to cause trouble.<!--\n              -->The highly respected Teyiz was simply amazed that Xilonen had the patience to endure such tedious classes.<!--\n              -->Most children had no interest in such things, preferring classes where the elders told them legends about the heroes of the various tribes. They would imagine themselves as those heroes, skipping right past all the hardship and pain, going straight for fame and glory.<!--\n              -->Xilonen, on the other hand, had no interest in these stories. Yet to ensure that she passed her exams on such subjects, she would \"bribe\" her classmates with milk candies, getting them to lend her their notes. She would proceed to copy it all down, then force herself to memorize everything, just to get a score that would not raise eyebrows.<!--\n              -->Her strength and her passion lay not in empty fantasies, but rather in precise axioms and equations. As far as she saw it, these were the only things that would benefit future generations; these were the things that were worth studying.<!--\n              -->As for those stories... Well, they were neither accurate nor concise, lacked both definitions and axioms, and were simply too chaotic to follow. They held no value for her beyond the points they were worth on the exam papers.<!--\n              -->Despite seeing all of this, Teyiz chose not to immediately stop Xilonen, nor did she tell her off.<!--\n              -->But when the next class was about to begin, and Xilonen got ready to roll out one of her usual excuses — like having a stomachache, or feeling dizzy, or catching a cold — Teyiz cut right through them, one and all.<!--\n              -->\"I once thought the same way as you do, Xilonen.\"<!--\n              -->Thus did the kindly Name Engraver address her student, patting the notebook of equations that she held.<!--\n              -->\"But remember — for us Name Engravers, stories and equations are, in essence, one and the same.\""

Though they had read similar stories in books before, the way Teyiz told them was much more detailed, and far more vivid.<!--\n              -->There was one hero who pulled down a stalactite, using it as a spear to pierce a monster's eye; and another who crossed a deep ravine with naught but a single length of rope in solo pursuit of a wicked dragon...<!--\n              -->Layer upon layer of exciting detail brought these heroes to life, making them flesh and blood in the children's minds.<!--\n              -->But an abundance of detail creates greater possibilities for contradiction.<!--\n              -->The first child to look up and challenge the storyteller was a little boy who had read many books and had many questions.<!--\n              -->\"Excuse me, Ma'am, I have a question. In the records I've read, this hero went hunting in the company of his companions. But in your story, he's alone.

Well, that's what I read...\"<!--\n              -->The elderly Name Engraver laughed, then patiently rejoined:<!--\n              -->\"Then you are questioning the truth on the basis of a single opinion, and have neither proof nor evidence.\"<!--\n              -->The child, still refusing to concede defeat, puffed out his chest and replied:<!--\n              -->\"Stories... How can there be evidence for stories? There are so many out there in the world, it would be impossible to prove them all.\"<!--\n              -->After all, most stories and legends are passed down from mouth to mouth, so over time it is inevitable that they will change and evolve. Even the same tale, the same hero, might end up being portrayed in entirely different ways by the storytellers of different tribes.<!--\n              -->Xilonen, who had been listening for quite some time now, closed her eyes in boredom and began working out a new set of formulas in her head. The idea that there was no order to be found just about summed up her view on the subject too, and as such, she concluded that it was unworthy of further attention.<!--\n              -->To their surprise, Teyiz nodded to show her approval of the child's answer, and then said:<!--\n              -->\"You speak the truth. Natlan is an ocean of heroic legends, and perhaps there really is no way to verify such stories.\"<!--\n              -->\"Through generations of oral tradition, countless stories have been twisted or exaggerated, focusing on one person's great achievements, while secretly diminishing another's...\"<!--\n              -->\"But one day, it will be you that holds the forge hammer, and you will be the one tasked with forging the heroic deeds of those who have gone before into Ancient Names.\"<!--\n              -->\"When that day comes, if the heroic deeds you are to engrave are likewise the subject matter of countless unverified tales, and the focus of unstemmed controversy and debate...\"<!--\n              -->\"How then will you strike the hammer? How then will you know which version to settle on?\"<!--\n              -->Despite having been laughing just moments before, the sudden weight of this responsibility made the children fall silent.<!--\n              -->\"Legends have their patterns, and stories, too, their truths.\"<!--\n              -->\"You have heard many stories, just as you have read many scrolls.\"<!--\n              -->\"Now, it's time for your next class.\"<!--\n              -->Very slightly, Xilonen opened her eyes.<!--\n              -->If stories were to be approached from such an angle, she thought, perhaps there might be more in them than she'd given them credit for."

They combed through every detail, hoping to find connections that could link these stories to other records, trying to add a rough but traceable chain of evidence to prove their credibility.<!--\n              -->The children, who once found those very same tales to be a source of endless excitement and entertainment, now found themselves thinking of ways to avoid the class.<!--\n              -->\"If we keep studying like this, I won't want to read another story... ever again!\"<!--\n              -->\"I know, right?

There are so many people in the tribe — why don't you just find someone else to do it?\"<!--\n              -->Xilonen had often observed her father at work. He always wore a big smile on his face whenever he talked business with others, but when the time came to start swinging his hammer, his face would naturally settle into a grim expression. Work always seemed to drain people of their energy, leaving them exhausted both mentally and physically.<!--\n              -->\"Dad, why did you become a Name Engraver? You must have had a pretty important reason.\"<!--\n              -->\"Not really, nothing particularly important. I just thought that people who listened to stories... They have a responsibility to pass them down to others too.\" Her father replied as he put down his hammer, wiping the sweat from his brow.<!--\n              -->\"But aren't there much simpler ways to do that?

As if driven by an endless store of energy, she traveled all over the Children of Echoes' lands, interviewing everyone and anyone connected to Teyiz, reviewing every document she could find that mentioned her old teacher's name. Yet that wasn't enough for Xilonen. She left the tribe, consulting couriers from the Scions of the Canopy, meeting musicians from the People of the Springs, requesting access to the woven scrolls of the Masters of the Night-Wind, scaling the cliffs of the Flower-Feather Clan, stepping through the gates of the Collective of Plenty... With the utmost rigor and painstaking care, Xilonen meticulously recorded every single trace that Teyiz had left out there in the world.<!--\n              -->Not only were these documents what she needed to refute the slanderous stories and malicious rumors about Teyiz — they were enough to dismiss the strange titles that some had bestowed upon her too.<!--\n              -->What Xilonen wanted to leave behind was a true, unblemished version of Teyiz.<!--\n              -->Only flawless ores of the utmost strength could be refined, forged, and eventually tempered into something worthy of being handed down to posterity.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->\"Xilonen, why did you set out to become a Name Engraver in the first place?

                "text": "Where should the first hammerstroke fall?<!--\n              -->As Xilonen gripped the haft, preparing to get started on the first Ancient Name she had ever forged, she hesitated, unsure of how to strike.<!--\n              -->She had done plenty of research and prepared everything that was required. Just a few days before, she had followed a mining team from the tribe into the mountains to find ore of the very finest quality. She had also asked her dad to modify the furnace so it could hold even more phlogiston, igniting a fiercer and hotter flame that would be intense enough to melt any ore. She had specially re-engraved all of the phlogiston engraving diagrams in the workshop, ensuring that every spark that flew during the forging process was under her complete control.<!--\n              -->Alright, Xilonen, everything's ready. Strike while the phlogiston's hot, huh? So... Where should the first strike fall? What pattern should I forge? How many strikes will it take?<!--\n              -->Silence filled the workshop, and even the flames dared not crackle, lest they disturb the craftswoman at work.<!--\n              -->Placing her hammer aside, Xilonen picked up a comb fashioned from the tooth of a wild beast in its stead. This comb had been polished sleek and smooth, investing the intense fire that reflected off its surface with a mild, gentler warmth.<!--\n              -->Its previous owner was a kindly old woman. Whenever Xilonen used to slack off, she would offer to comb her hair as a way of coaxing her back to study.<!--\n              -->The old woman would also braid her hair into beautiful, intricate plaits — so complex, in fact, that even Xilonen's mother could not work out how to recreate them, and eventually had to ask for her help. After all, above all others, those were the plaits that Xilonen loved.<!--\n              -->The story of Teyiz the Name Engraver resurfaced in Xilonen's mind. That was a story she had hunted down and gathered herself; and now, she would be the one to forge it into a Name.<!--\n              -->A hammer blow shattered the silence. Each strike was precise and powerful, and no detail of the story was left untold. Even the most fleeting nuances now rose up before her, ready to be wrought by her hammer.<!--\n              -->As the final drops of phlogiston were consumed and the furnace began to fade, before her she beheld a brand-new Ancient Name.<!--\n              -->Teyiz's story had been imprinted into this Name, never to be distorted again.<!--\n              -->As for whom the Wayob would bestow it upon... Well, that was the Wayob's concern, not hers.<!--\n              -->Xilonen stood up, dusted off her clothes, and began to tidy up her workshop. She bent down to toss away a few unused pieces of ore into a basket — they were all of excellent quality, and could certainly be re-used for something else.<!--\n              -->\"Hmm, wonder what I should eat later? Didn't Mom say we'd be having fish for dinner...?\"<!--\n              -->One, two, three... the lumps of ore clinked as they landed in her basket.<!--\n              -->Absorbed entirely by her dinner plans, Xilonen didn't notice that there was something quite special about the fourth, amber-colored \"ore\" in her hand.<!--\n              -->With another soft clink, the Vision landed in her basket too, which Xilonen then carried out of the workshop and casually left outside.<!--\n              -->Humming a song, Xilonen went off to eat her dinner. It was only during her next forging session that she would finally notice this special \"ore\" of hers.<!--\n              -->It was a gift; but also, a responsibility."

At the time, she would keep coming to the workshop to talk about it and insist that I make her a phlogiston-powered vehicle. She even shoved a bunch of design schematics in front of me, and yeah, who even knows where she got those... I eventually couldn't take it anymore and gave in.

It's just like what my father always said — \"When every person in Natlan takes up the responsibility they can shoulder, Natlan will stand strong forever.\" The job is now my duty, and I perform it regardless of my level of personal interest....And on top of that, I was the most skilled among those who studied the craft in the tribe. If I didn't become a Name Engraver, that would mean someone else would have to take it on in my stead. The other students constantly asked me questions and copied my homework. Had it become their job to forge Ancient Names, I'm sure they would constantly come bothering me with questions. So I figured that taking the job myself would be better than dealing with all that trouble... Yeah, it's more convenient for everyone, and saves me from having to worry about other people's work all day."
