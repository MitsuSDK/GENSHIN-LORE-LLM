Nor does she dress up or mince her words, even if her results are unpleasant to hear: \"You won't amount to anything even if you join the Adventurers' Guild.\" \"You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you\" &mdash; such is the nature of her rejoinders.\nHer blunt nature has resulted in plummeting numbers of people coming to have their fortunes told. But Mona isn't one to complain, for that just leaves her with more time for her personal research.\nBut when one speaks of research, one also speaks of the necessity of purchasing texts and research apparatus. Mona's only income comes from her contributions to The Steambird's \"All Things Astrological\" column. Every paycheck is spent first on her research. Books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... all of these come with a hefty price tag, and by the time Mona regains her senses, there's only enough of her income left for her to scrape by each month.\n\"It matters not. Astrologers must rid themselves of material desires. Only by ridding oneself of clutter can one see the true world around them.\" So says Mona, coughing loudly all the while to cover the sound of her growling stomach.\nToday, too, is another day Mona worries about Mora."

Well, you'll see.\"That was the warning Mona received before departing.To Mona's surprise, this successor was none other than the Spark Knight, Klee.The box was still extant, but due to Klee's actions and a series of accidents... Mona unwittingly unraveled the enigma behind the box.\"I—I'm done for. The thing inside this was the dark history of her youth... she will kill me if I go back like this...\"Mona was thus forced to stay in Mondstadt, beginning a bitterly frugal but bountifully fulfilling existence."

That's a lie.\"\"You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you.\"The cold, hard truth is laid bare before people's eyes, complete with all the grisly details that they would rather remained buried.Mona will make no exceptions to this, and as such she can seem completely lacking in human emotion.But sometimes, on a clear night, she can be seen on a high mountain slope.There, Mona gazes up at the stars in the sky — so close, she feels, that she could almost reach out and touch them — with gentle eyes, humming an unknown tune to herself."

If not for some relief funds coming from time to time, she would have had trouble eking out a living.Mona does in fact have some money set aside. Even though she must eventually run dry without an income, she can slow the bleeding by scrimping in the food department.So where does the rest of the Mora go? Well, if you've ever had a look inside her lab, then know that the big pile of astrology-related apparatus and tools in there didn't come out of thin air.In fact, all of them come with a hefty price tag — books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... The shipping fees alone are impressive.That Mona should be in abject poverty comes, therefore, as no surprise.In order to support herself, Mona eventually took up a commercial contract — her contributions to a column about constellation in The Steambird have become her most stable income source.Now having a monthly income, Mona could have left her life of poverty. But how could an astrologist's pursuit of knowledge end here?Whenever she gets paid, Mona will immediately shell out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more.This process plays out every month.Today, too, is another day Mona worries over Mora."

The techniques passed down to me are exceptional, of course, but my teacher is not my equal.Does she know the market rates for eggs, butter, or wheat? In this regard, I have already far surpassed her.\""

Some neither had food nor warm clothes, living no differently from beggars.And it was just such an adventurer who, when meeting Mona while she was out looking for fruits and vegetables to fill her stomach, shared half their food with her.\"Out here, we've gotta have each other's backs.\"This was not something inscribed on these so-called principles of the world. And many other such things she encountered on her journey — the honesty of a thief, a robber's change of heart, a coward's courage, the good deeds of a wicked person...Mona began to have some doubts, but she also felt like she finally had her feet on solid ground.When she was again alone with her thoughts under the stars, she marveled that her research had been so full of holes.Perhaps she would have to continue researching the world's principles for the rest of her life."

That she had this opportunity at all was pure chance.When the previous contributing author was traveling the world, he heard tell of a strange astrologist, and his hobbyist's curiosity compelled him to seek her out.Their correspondence left him deeply impressed.As it happened, he was also looking to retire, and seeing that Mona was strapped for Mora, reached out to help her by recommending her to the editor-in-chief of The Steambird.When Mona released her first column, \"An Introduction to Astrology,\" the column, heretofore known for being easy reading, experienced a massive shift in tone.Most of each issue was dedicated to discussing the movement of celestial bodies and other difficult (and obscure) topics. Academic quotations, dense footnotes and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings.The editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic. Would it find acceptance with long-time readers? As it turned out, there was no need to fret. The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this:\"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting. Consider me a fan of Astrologist Mona Megistus.\"After getting approval to continue submitting manuscripts, Mona could finally heave a sigh of relief.Now, how best to celebrate... Ah yes. Perhaps she should use her first paycheck to purchase that latest-edition planetarium she'd had her eye on for a while now..."

Mona seeks the final truth of the world, hidden amidst the sea of stars.As such, she does not have any reverence for her Vision, which the people of this world consider to be a sign of divine favor and the source of all power.Nonetheless, this item that serves no practical use in her hands is something that she treasures greatly.It was gifted to her by her teacher as a teaching aid, and it is the only evidence of their time together as master and pupil.She preserves these distant memories with great care.
