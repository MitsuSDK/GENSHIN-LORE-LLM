Answering the call of destiny, we have descended upon Teyvat.\nFischl introduces herself to every member of the Adventurers' Guild in this way.\nDue to her shared vision with the raven Oz, Fischl was able to join the Adventurers' Guild and become an investigator with ease.\nInitially, it gave members of the Guild great difficulty to comprehend what Fischl was saying. But thanks to her tireless toil, and Oz's industrious interpretation, everyone was finally able to understand her.\nThough eccentric in word and deed, this investigator's reconnaissance is swift and her intelligence accurate, traits that allowed her to gradually win everyone's trust.\nIt helps that Fischl is also a very kind person.\n\"Oz, my familiar... spread your wings that eclipse the sun, and keep watch over the one to whom ill fate clings like a shroud.\"\n\"Yes, .\"\nToday, Fischl shall also show concern for the masses of the Adventurers' Guild in her own manner."

Not everyone gets to be the Prinzessin der Verurteilung's familiar, do you understand? Consider it your honor to dedicate your life to serving me!\"Fischl is able to see through Oz's eyes. Whenever she wants to, she possesses Oz and looks down upon the earth from the sky.Whether she wants to inspect the flora on the Stormbearer Mountains or observe a disturbance in Wolvendom, through Oz she can see anything and everything.Thanks largely to her unique ability — and, to a lesser extent, to her own effort and peculiar personality — Fischl quickly went from the rookie investigator of the Adventurers' Guild to a respected rising star of the organization.She's certainly done well for herself. She only landed the coveted position of Investigator at age fourteen in the first place because her parents managed to persuade the guild master.Then again, would they really have had to do much persuading? If she's the Prinzessin der Verurteilung... one can only assume that would make them the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung."

So you do understand. Then fate does indeed bring kindred spirits together.\"Those who manage to adopt her speech mannerisms when they respond to her will find she is both delighted and bashful, and praises their language-learning ability.\"A prinzessin should always give praise where praise is due...

You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.'\"\"Oh, that's a lovely story. Since you like it so much, {{Obf|Amy}}, how about I call you \"Fischl\" too?\" Her father smiled, put his hand on her head and repeated the words from the story to her.\"Fischl, you are my wonderful princess and my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.\"These kind and loving words lit up her world.However, the time with her busy parents was always fleeting.Unable to fit in with her peers due to her obsession with fantasy novels, she often felt lonely and sad. At these times, she would remind herself:\"I am Fischl, my daddy's wonderful princess.

My parents will understand,\" she thought to herself.For if she knew one thing, it was that as a princess she could never surrender her nobility and dreams.But when she threw herself into her parents' arms in need of comfort, she was met instead with gentle words of exasperation.\"{{Obf|Amy}}, you are fourteen years old now. It's fun to make-believe, but eventually you need to grow up and put your childish dreams behind you...\"And with that, the same voice that had once lit up her world now tore it apart.That day at midnight, she hid herself in the library she knew so well.

Just a little twist of fate, nothing more.The Prinzessin will come to understand someday that each moment of her life, no matter how insignificant their little twists could be, is to be treasured.After all, the Prinzessin's very own Phantasmagoria is made out of ones such as these."

Oz, when playing along, uses a few German phrases himself.\n** \"Prinzessin der Verurteilung\" means \"Princess of Condemnation.\"\n** \"Immernachtreich\" means \"Kingdom of Eternal Night.\"{{Verify}}\n** \"Edelstein der Dunkelheit,\" which she uses to refer to her Vision, means \"Gem of Darkness.\"\n** \"Mein Fräulein\" means \"my lady.\"\n** \"Mitternachtsbrot des Sommernachtgartens\" means \"Midnight Bread of the Summer Night Garden.\"\n* While her Story makes it rather clear that Fischl is not from a world beyond Teyvat, she seems to possess some knowledge that others don't. Unlike many other characters, she acknowledges that the Traveler is from another world, apparently without having been told.\n\n==Navigation==\n{{Character Navbox|VO}}\n\nes:Fischl/Voz\nfr:Fischl/Répliques\nit:Fischl/Battute\nja:フィッシュル/ボイス/英語\npt-br:Fischl/Falas\nru:Фишль/Озвучка\nth:Fischl/เสียงพากย์\ntr:Fischl/Replikler"
