There should no longer have been residents there, but as if destiny had decreed it, a farmer had come there, picking Naku Weed to make a living. Thus it was under the moonlight that he saw a phantom figure standing on the edge of the cliff.\nThis person wore a wide hat that concealed their face entirely. However, the farmer could hear breathing through the pitter-patter of the rain.\nA moment later, the figure spoke. \"This is how humans should breathe.\"\nThe farmer was terrified that he might had encountered some spirit, and hurriedly hid behind a rock. The figure spoke again. \"What are you afraid of? Would a passerby such as I hurt you? I am merely here to tend to the grave of a friend.\"\nSilence filled the air once more. The farmer peeked out from behind the rock, and saw that the figure had vanished. A note drifted to the ground and was instantly soaked by the rain. Three questions had been written on that piece of paper, along with answers that were not yet fully written—\nIf humans have a heart, why do they not fear the hearts of others?\nDue to their inferior nature.\nHow should one treat others, knowing full well their inferiority?\n...\nHow can one be a human being without a heart?\nOne without a heart is hardly human.\nChills ran down the farmer's spine as he finished reading the note. Tatarasuna had been deserted for many years, and it had been a long time since anyone came here to pay their respects. And even if there were, why would they appear on such a night?"

The flaming maple leaves, the exquisite window lattices... Within that lovely prison, he lost all perception.<!--\n              -->It was by accident that a kind-hearted samurai named Katsuragi would enter the pavilion and rescue him. It was Katsuragi who brought him to live in Tatarasuna and meet the people who lived there.<!--\n              -->Then, the puppet was as naive as a newborn, filled with goodwill and gratitude towards humans. Katsuragi, upon seeing the golden pinion on his person, knew that this puppet must not have been of ordinary stock, yet have his reasons not to mention his place of origin. Thus, he omitted all mention of Shakkei Pavilion, instead claiming falsely that he had found the young man while patroling Nazuchi Beach, and he bade the puppet play along so as to not expose the lie.<!--\n              -->Busy, bustling Tatarasuna was a place of many happy memories for the puppet. There, he was briefly human. There, he was briefly normal.<!--\n              -->Katsuragi, Mikoshi Nagamasa, Niwa, Miyazaki, and many other now-forgotten people from Tatarasuna would teach him to read and write, to start fires and make meals, to forge — yes, they accepted him as their friend.<!--\n              -->They even asked him: \"Don't you want a name?

Yes, they made him different, but such was proof of his humanity — proof that he belonged in Tatarasuna.<!--\n              -->Pity, then, that though he loved this name so, he would be forced to forsake it. For when he no longer wished to become human, it lost its meaning.<!--\n              -->He would depart, and after arriving in the distant north, would join the wild banquet of the Harbingers, working to win the sixth seat among them.<!--\n              -->It was the Tsaritsa who would grant him his new title — \"The Balladeer.\" Strength, power, and the desire for conflict — these he already possessed.<!--\n              -->The chess pieces raised tides of madness amidst battle, and the slaughterers on the stage upended order.<!--\n              -->In that moment, he was sure that The Balladeer was his true name."

The two cooperated very closely to further improve forging quality, and in the process, Akame introduced Escher to Niwa, who was also from the three Isshin traditions.<!--\n              -->Escher's arrival caused quite the stir for a time, for it was through his revolutionary new techniques that they were able to process Crystal Marrow in such a way that their forging efficacy and production were both increased.<!--\n              -->But as time passed, anomalies emerged within the great central furnace in Tatarasuna. Black gas gathered within the furnace, and it would gradually affect the bodies of the craftspeople there. Forging and smelting were the foundations of life in Tatarasuna, but now they had become death itself.<!--\n              -->And as the toll mounted, the great furnace further went out of control. None could get close to its core, and even stopping it became nigh impossible.<!--\n              -->As the highest authority at Tatarasuna, Niwa was forced to enact an information blackout while sending people to Inazuma City to beg aid from Tenshukaku.<!--\n              -->For some reason, however, those who took to the sea in ships never returned. Horror began seeping into the hearts of Tatarasuna's people.<!--\n              -->The Kabukimono knew that Niwa needed the Raiden Shogun's aid, but did not know that this was the very year when she had successfully built the perfect puppet using parts of herself as material, thus handing over management of the nation to the Guardian of Eternity. He thus boarded a small boat and braved storm and rain to arrive at Tenshukaku, seeking an audience with the Shogun.<!--\n              -->But she now dwelled in the Plane of Euthymia, and he was repeatedly refused. In desperation, he displayed the golden feather on his person and asked to see Yae Miko instead.<!--\n              -->At this time, Miko was busy assisting the Guardian, and though she rushed down as soon as she heard this news, she could only meet the distressed Kabukimono briefly. Yet he had no ears for her promises to send people to their aid immediately, and returned in despair, convinced that the Shogunate had forsaken Tatarasuna.<!--\n              -->Still, the dispatch was sent, the people were mobilized, and they crossed by sea. Yet they arrived to no great disaster. Indeed, most people knew nothing of what had happened. It was the mechanic, Escher, who explained that Niwa had fled with his family for fear of punishment for his malfeasance, and that the Kabukimono had gone into the core zone in his place, shutting the furnace down.<!--\n              -->Receiving word that the Kabukimono had been friends with the fleeing Niwa, Yae guessed at the heaviness in his heart and did not wish to further disturb him, merely sending someone to return the feather to him.<!--\n              -->Later still, he would disappear without a trace from Tatarasuna. But as people reminisced, they could never forget the celebratory dance he had performed together with them on the day that Mikoshi Nagamasa successfully forged his great blade.<!--\n              -->His steps fluttered lightly like a feather in the wind then, and they could not have known that he, like a feather, would depart from them and journey to places unknown."

Seeing his constantly mud-caked face through the gaps in the decrepit wooden door, the Kabukimono felt something twist in his heart, as if some ancient feeling was being re-awakened. And so, he stayed within that wooden house to care for that sick boy, bringing him melons, fruits, and water to drink, helping him to wipe the filth from his face.<!--\n              -->Many days passed, and the child's parents did not return. It was only later that the Kabukimono learned that the parents were also workers from Tatarasuna, and they might have lived normal and happy lives, if not for husband and wife contracting some strange illness during their work, often coughing up blood as a result. That they had not returned indicated that they may have passed without any fanfare in some place out there.<!--\n              -->The child's name was unimportant, for he had another identity: he was the Kabukimono's friend, and family besides. They talked about how they had been born and promised to continue to live together in that ramshackle hut.

One night, barely enough time for the Kabukimono to go out and find some food or swipe some furniture that others no longer had any use for.<!--\n              -->Though he had already witnessed much change, he never knew that another person's passing was something that could occur in such a brief moment, or that this moment could grant him nothing but pain.<!--\n              -->After the shock, he felt incomparable fury.

The Kabukimono burned the wooden house, and finding himself an old straw hat from within it, left to begin his long journey.<!--\n              -->He wandered everywhere, not knowing where to go, and though he would meet many more people along the way, he would never again regard any of them as his companions."
