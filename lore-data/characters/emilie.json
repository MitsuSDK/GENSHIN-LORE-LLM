Such are the traces erased by her touch, everything made as good as new.\nIf you've never before heard of a \"forensic cleaner,\" you might at first struggle to imagine what such a profession entails.\nBut if you're lucky enough to become acquainted with Emilie, feel free to ask her a question or two. She is both an excellent listener and an exemplary respondent, so you'll no doubt receive a satisfactory answer."

Compared to such considerations, the precise identity of the perfumer who prepared the scent is not a factor that needs to be contemplated when making one's choice.<!--\n              -->Alas, neither customers' views nor popular trends are easily shifted. A herd mentality that craves security often leads people to prefer purchasing from well-known brands or designers, for one rarely goes wrong that way.<!--\n              -->Fame, therefore, is a double-edged sword.

As to other case details, she is neither curious nor inclined to ask further questions.<!--\n              -->The bodies, as well as severely damaged objects, have already been removed. And so she inspects the area meticulously, making mental notes of things that might be easily missed or difficult-to-clean areas that require extra attention.<!--\n              -->She has encountered many such crime scenes, and with time, has been able to piece together in broad strokes the sequence of events — through the directions of blood spatter, the traces left by the residue of human tissues, and how objects fell.<!--\n              -->Still, this is not her professional duty. In the most infrequent of circumstances, of course, she will be invited to use this experience to aid the Maison in recreating crime scenes. But this is not one of those special cases. This case is already closed, and as a \"forensic cleaner,\" she needs only draw a line under it.<!--\n              -->And so she silently dons her protective clothing and goggles, and gets to work. All goes well. Chemicals dissolve and wash away the rust and dark-brown, even black-colored stains, while sticky tissues and sharp fragments are cleaned separately. The harrowing scene and horrid smells are wiped away, erased like erroneous brushstrokes from a canvas.<!--\n              -->Finally, she invites the Garde, who has been waiting all this time outside, back in. They convey their thanks and bid her farewell, before manually removing the cordon.<!--\n              -->Emilie remains silent as she changes back into her previous outfit. She cannot help but think that though the deceased should already have been buried as those dear to them watched, parts of them have only just now been put to rest.<!--\n              -->She adjusts her hat, nodding her head slightly toward the clean room, bidding a final farewell to persons completely unknown to her, as if she too were taking some small part in their funerals."

Short passages containing such personality analyses are often found in the corners of Fontainian magazines and tabloids, and they even rerun every few days, as if the editors think people cobble their self-understanding together from such fragmentary pieces — not to mention possess deficient memories.<!--\n              -->Such ideas are clearly stereotypes, for none would claim that Emilie wants for creativity, while her home is perfectly spick and span. To claim that a perfumer so famous lacks imagination, her modestness or otherwise notwithstanding, would be to categorically deny the Fontainian perfuming profession in its totality.<!--\n              -->But Emilie's home is, if anything, overly clean. Few furnishings stand atop the visible flooring, and most items have been carefully packed into hermetic compartments. Indeed, one can barely tell that anyone lives there. Even friends who occasionally visit, such as Chiori, bluntly ask if this is a manifestation of some kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder.<!--\n              -->Emilie simply laughs, saying: \"It has to be this way, that's all.\"<!--\n              -->Her dwelling is not large, but it has two workshops, one for perfuming, and the other for mixing the chemicals needed for her work. Neither allows for flasks or other items to be placed haphazardly, and so, while she has no love of daily drudgeries or household chores, Emilie has had to slowly learn the strict art of organized stowage and storage, habitually drawing clear lines between the different aspects of her life.<!--\n              -->This terrifying discipline is something she has mastered with some ease — just as one separates dangerous reagents into separate vials, so too does she create freely in one bottle, while accumulating the experience that crystallizes out of solutions in another."

She was fascinated by the mystery of chemical reactions, and began to formally study related disciplines. Such skills should surely prove useful, but just what kind of work should she pursue? Work in a crime lab, perhaps — so her father suggested.<!--\n              -->Though, such work always came with an element of danger, so it was best to learn a little self-defense from him first if she wanted to join — so he quickly added.<!--\n              -->For a long time afterward, Emilie would work toward this goal.<!--\n              -->But one day, her parents opened a bottle of red wine before the meal, as they lamented what had happened that day—<!--\n              -->The Marechaussee Phantom's duties were to pursue the truth, but once that was done, any remaining fallout was left in the hands of the heartbroken bereaved.

Thus, Emilie truly treasures such opportunities.<!--\n              -->Collecting perfumes was once her mother's hobby, but due to her work, she was able to apply them less than frequently, and so those top-shelf fragrances would eventually become Emilie's treasures. She loved the shiny bottles and the clear fluids within, basking in the mysterious reactions produced by interwoven aromas.<!--\n              -->It was due to her hobby of perfumery that she later became quite taken with traveling to gather materials.<!--\n              -->She has scaled snowy mountains few have traversed, and squeezed her way through the packed markets of other lands. Fragrances are shapeless, and are thus easily overlooked, but they are a necessary component of any person's living environment. Most people have somewhat unvaried preferences in this regard, but Emilie accepts all comers. Good, bad, simple, complex, Emilie carefully categorizes them all in her heart, and they form for her a bridge to understanding this world.<!--\n              -->From such a perspective, fragrances are no luxury, but rather, a thing that people can naturally enjoy... and thus, perfumes should be no different.<!--\n              -->Of course, this is very much against market trends. It is practically taken as a given that those crystalline, gem-like products should be placed under the searing spotlight and sold at extravagant prices.<!--\n              -->And Emilie remains but a hobbyist, and as such, cannot change this state of affairs by herself. Thus, many of her works have never reached the shelves of any shop. As one who works outdoors herself, she has designed insect-repelling, anti-perspiration perfume, though such a notion doesn't even sound remotely romantic. She also developed a fragrance specifically for Melusines to enjoy, but humans seemed unwilling to buy them.<!--\n              -->Not that she was disappointed, of course. That she could get these products into the hands of those who needed them was satisfaction enough.<!--\n              -->Of course, she does have some real regrets. For example, the risk of small animals knocking over or inadvertently ingesting chemicals keeps her from having a psychological support pet, which limits her to playing with other people's puppies in the park.<!--\n              -->Naturally, she also has to avoid wearing perfume when going to meet them.

Being meticulous in her preparation of the relevant cleaning agents, she gradually discovered that Fontainian human tissue structures seemed to have minuscule differences from those of other nations.<!--\n              -->Discreetly investigating, she discovered something strange that very, very few had ever noticed. Even those who had some awareness would simply attribute it to Fontaine's special natural environment. After all, people in some places experienced greater hair loss, while people in others had naturally slim fingers... All a matter of their living in the same environment giving rise to those traits.<!--\n              -->Emilie sensed that the truth might not be so simple, but she tentatively accepted that explanation.<!--\n              -->At least, she did until after the \"prophecy\" had already come to pass and she received some new cleaning commissions.

A person responds to things based on their experiences, and in such matters, one cannot generalize.

Monsieur Neuvillette once tried to recommend my services to him, but apparently he thought that the Fortress of Meropide would have no occasion for them.I can't know what his reasons were for turning me down, as I've never met him in person. But if I was to speculate... I would say perhaps there are certain things he doesn't want washed away. Perhaps he prefers to leave them there... as a warning."

He reached out to me first, writing a letter after tracking down my details through some roundabout way. He was extremely polite, and it was incredibly flattering to have such a renowned botanist ask for my flower-related expertise. But, I also saw it as a chance to learn from him. I decided to ask some of my own questions, particularly about perfume ingredients from Sumeru, and he gave me thorough answers to each and every one.Now, our correspondence is much more casual. He even tells me about his companions sometimes. I really am delighted I got this opportunity to make a new friend."

On top of that, her mind is so quick — she can recognize subtle links between pieces of information and can instantly put her knowledge into practice. Some people think she was blessed with a natural culinary gift. But, I believe the secret to her success is self-evident."

It can be boiled down to a simple chemistry experiment, really. It's up to the perfumer to bridge the gap between the product's artistic and scientific qualities, and doing that with any degree of success takes quite a bit of skill."

Wouldn't it be nice if there were a way of doing a shelf-life test for interpersonal relationships?"

Something I do in my spare time, just like how some people learn to play a musical instrument or make crafts.Still, my goal in life wasn't always to be a forensic cleaner. My mother works as a forensic pathologist, and ever since I was little, I knew I wanted to work in criminal investigations just like her. For a long time, my talent for chemistry inspired me to pursue trace evidence analysis. But as I progressed further in my studies, I started to encounter real-life crime scenes. I'll never forget one scene I saw... A young child had been murdered, there was blood soaked into the carpet and splattered all over the walls... And after the investigators finished their assessment, they just left. I couldn't imagine what those poor parents were going through... it didn't seem right that they had to clean up after their own child's murder, all by themselves.So, yeah. That's what led me into forensic cleaning."
