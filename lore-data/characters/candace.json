Every grain of sand is her scout and no one can escape from her grasp.\nBut a young adventurer who was about to leave for the desert looked surprised. He replied that Miss Candace, the guardian of Aaru Village, was actually a gentle and caring person.\nDuring a visit to Aaru Village, he had seen Miss Candace bring water and food to a hungry Treasure Hoarder, and arranged for another exhausted mercenary to rest in the guest room... In the eyes of this adventurer, \"terrifying\" is the last word one could use to describe this guardian...\nCandace, who is far away in the Great Red Sand, was unaware of this little debate about her - although she doesn't mind what people think about her.\nAs the guardian of Aaru Village, it is her duty to protect the peace of the village.\nAs long as they abide by the rules of Aaru Village, anyone can seek refuge here and receive the help they need.\nAs for those who violate the rules and commit atrocities in the village...\nCandace will personally ensure that they never harm the village again."
