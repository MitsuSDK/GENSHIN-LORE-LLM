                "text": "During harvest season, no visitor would be considered too strange a guest at the festivities. As the setting sun cast its light over the marketplace, such a scene soon unfolded: A certain gentleman arrived as well, and curious locals soon drew him into their lively conversations.\nThe gentleman introduced himself: Flins, a warrior of the Lightkeepers. He had been awarded a civilian commendation medal in recognition of his squad's efforts in repelling Abyssal creatures. The incident happened a long time ago. Though no one had stepped forward to organize it, the people wordlessly agreed to express their gratitude this way. The medal had been heavy, delivered to him in a timeworn box.\nConsidering how many casualties the operation had racked up, Flins did not think even ten medals could do justice to the losses. There used to be more of them &mdash; seven or eight in his squad &mdash; but now, only Flins remained, guarding the cemetery near the lighthouse.\nFor a moment, the crowd fell silent. The story brought to mind many things: The Wild Hunt, the monsters... as well as other memories that weighed heavily on the heart. Sorrow rendered them speechless. Some others had questions, and so they asked them, but Flins did not answer. He kept his head down, seemingly reminiscing.\nCompared to other Lightkeepers, Flins spoke with an air of elegance. He did not deign to answer questions about his origins or whether he had any siblings. Instead, he was more inclined to talk about distant, unrelated matters. He had a way of recounting events with perfect measuredness, just as in conversation, never excessive. The past, through his words, made listeners think to themselves: \"What an unforgettable tale!\"\nConsidering the vast majority of his audience lacked much life experience, many who listened to Flins did so out of curiosity. And it just so happened that his actions fit precisely this need. He invariably selected tales perfectly tailored for public retelling."

                "text": "There is a small isle in the central-southern region of Nod-Krai that has earned the name \"Final Night Cemetery\" on account of its lonesome, dismal air. Few visit, and merchant caravans only sometimes loop far around it. Jutting above its soil is a lighthouse languishing in disuse, where only the spirits of the dead consent to dwell, it is said.<!--\n              -->Amidst the deathly silence, only one living soul remains. This gentleman tends to introduce himself as such: Flins, a warrior of the Lightkeepers, the awardee of a civilian commendation medal in recognition of his squad's efforts in repelling Abyssal creatures.<!--\n              -->The incident he mentions happened a long time ago. Though no one had stepped forward to organize it, the people had wordlessly agreed to express their gratitude this way, and so the heavy medal had been delivered to him, placed in a timeworn box.<!--\n              -->A solemn reward, one might think, but considering the casualties from that operation, Flins believed that not even ten medals could make the losses worthwhile. The squad once had seven or eight members, but now he was the only one left on the island.<!--\n              -->Apart from occasional business and the odd monthly purchase, Flins rarely shows up in town. Fortunately, this has not stopped the townspeople from remembering him, for he was easier to communicate with than they had imagined. Even his dull, boring clothes are made memorable by his elegant, decorous speech. No wonder people are curious — unexpected people and matters are always more eye-catching, after all.<!--\n              -->Most talk to him out of curiosity, albeit restrained by politeness. Curious about his past, people of all sorts have invited him to join gatherings to share old Lightkeeper stories. These he tells splendidly, such that many gazes have drifted downward when he reaches the saddening segments of said tales. This has led to many audiences not being willing to touch on his old scars any further.<!--\n              -->The residents revere Flins's occasional sorrow, unaware that this sorrow is another manifestation of distance — the audience's guilt becoming the teller's shield. Once someone feels this sympathy, the various narratives they have heard will take on meaning, convincing people that his melancholy deserves time and space. Whether out of courtesy or concern, no one should continue to pick at a good person's wounds, surely.<!--\n              -->No one despises the good people around them. The residents feel this way, and so does Flins. He is fond of those who are both interested and sympathetic, just as people enjoy the heroic tales he repeatedly tells. From another perspective, viewing each other as good people is an exceptional social strategy — a well-told heroic narrative is always dazzling enough to conceal all the mysteries that lie behind it."

                "text": "Flins tells many stories, despite not being much of a storyteller. This image is far from, even contradictory to, the social identity he strives to maintain, for stories spark curiosity, and he doesn't want to spend too much time on curious visitors. Fortunately, he's a flexible fellow and doesn't feel depressed about the discrepancies in his real life.<!--\n              -->The old lighthouse's door would often be knocked upon in the misty mornings, to which Flins would feign having just woken up. Though there were many possibilities for who the visitor might be, he wasn't entirely without clues — the lonely island rarely saw visitors in general, so those willing to come by fell into a few categories: Those with unwavering determination, those seeking help, or those undaunted by trouble.<!--\n              -->Not many people fit these categories, so he could immediately think of the following individuals. First was Lauma, Maiden of the Frostmoon Scions, who had come bearing a Feast of the Moon a few weeks prior. Despite his repeated refusals, claiming a lack of preference for dining at home and no capacity for establishing faith, she had nonetheless spent twenty minutes speaking to him. Then there was Jahoda, an employee of the Curatorium of Secrets' lady boss. She affected the look of a capable sort while at the door, an image undercut by her having come because she had gotten lost upon arrival on the island — indeed, by Flins having already saved her from falling off a cliff, completely unbeknownst to her. Then there was Varka, who had never spoken of his profession but was widely recognized as a knight. That said, Flins's experience with him was most akin to that which he had with tourists, for Varka had once come to the lighthouse to borrow supplies after his luggage was knocked over in a battle with monsters near the island, and later came back by boat to return them. Finally, there was Illuga, a fellow Lightkeeper, a righteous young man who, worried that Flins might die alone on the island far from their headquarters and human knowledge, regularly brought various supplies and work documents to check on him...<!--\n              -->Flins opened the door to find an unfamiliar adventurer standing in front of the tower. Just the previous day, he had purchased a peculiar gemstone from this person at the general store. The seller had spent at least ten minutes spinning tales to drive up the price of the stone, but they had met their match — Flins was a dab hand at both gemstone acquisition and crafting stories himself. In the end, they settled on a price ten percent above market value, though the seller then hesitated, saying they needed some time to find a better box for the gemstone so it could be presented more elegantly to its new owner.<!--\n              -->The visitor appeared nervous and took a while before speaking: \"The shopkeeper said you've been collecting gems and ancient coins, so I must be honest about something. As you can probably tell, someone of my experience couldn't possibly obtain a gem of this caliber alone... According to my family's inherited notes, it was a gift from a noble to my ancestor, and it's extremely precious. I wouldn't be selling it if I weren't in financial difficulties. So, I'm feeling somewhat reluctant to part with it for good...\"<!--\n              -->Perhaps in their imagination, Flins, as the buyer, should have been angry at this point. So when he praised them instead, they were extremely surprised. A few minutes later, they had fully accepted that praise and left to continue their adventures, carrying both money and the confidence that they would surely make a name for themselves somewhere in the future. As for the previously discussed topics like \"You seem to know about this gem, Mr. Flins, sir. Have you seen it before, then?\" and \"About that noble, sir, there isn't much written in my family's notes. Could you tell me more about it?\", the adventurer had already put them out of their mind.<!--\n              -->The story of the jewel itself was long and plain — little was lost by not hearing it. Besides, Flins did not want to talk about anything else today. He simply wanted to take a good look at this long-lost gem."

                "text": "Illuga was standing outside the door.<!--\n              -->Flins poured out two glasses of water and brought a pot over. Illuga watched him curiously.<!--\n              -->\"Two glasses. I'm guessing they're both for me?\"<!--\n              -->\"Dear Young Master Illuga, you have traveled a long way. Is it not only natural that you should have two cups of water? Indeed, you may have a third, or even a fourth. The pot is full.\"<!--\n              -->\"Not going to drink any?\" Illuga asked.<!--\n              -->\"I'm not thirsty.\"<!--\n              -->Illuga continued with this topic, as if there were nothing more normal in the world: \"You never get thirsty easily, and drinking alcohol seems more like a ritual than an interest to you. Could it be that you prefer drinking plain, tasteless water?\"<!--\n              -->Of course not, Flins thought. He detested tasteless water the most. However, he maintained his composure, brought over chairs, and they sat side by side in front of the lighthouse, basking in the sunlight.<!--\n              -->\"Last month, my colleagues asked me if you dislike sunlight, since you only seem to be active at night. They also asked when the last time you contacted the old man was. Also-also, why does everyone say they never see you come by, yet we hear that you not only visited but left without a trace?\"<!--\n              -->\"Well, now you can see me, just sitting here idly at the lighthouse entrance.\" Flins glanced inside the tower. \"My, you drink so quickly. My hospitality is lacking, it seems. Perhaps I should've brought you a whole bucket instead.\"<!--\n              -->\"It's been a long and tiring journey, as you said. Besides, if I didn't come running along every so often, this place of yours would wind up feeling too lifeless. And also, we need to sync up mission details with you.\"<!--\n              -->\"These words don't quite mean what they appear to, just like this 'they' you speak of may not even exist. All these questions are ones you wish to ask, in truth. Isn't that right, Young Master?\"<!--\n              -->\"Heh. Alright. Let's go with this one, then. Why do you call me 'Young Master'?\"<!--\n              -->\"You're clever and capable, and you know how to ask questions in a roundabout way, wrapping your curiosity in such politeness that no one feels offended. Your social graces would do nobility no shame, and so you've earned a suitable title.\"<!--\n              -->\"And if I'm a Young Master, what kind of person would be called a Lord? Please tell me more about that noble story you didn't finish last time, sir.\"<!--\n              -->\"Alright. Last time, we spoke of the era when the Belyi Tsar yet ruled, when the nobles were besotted with their balls and banquets. In those days, sociability was a currency most sought after. Such events not only exposed people to new knowledge, but also provided opportunities for, amongst other things, treasure and fine wine to be purchased. There were always some at the edges of this merrymaking who never danced, and they were more often not those here to find something special. Amongst such people were many whom one might call 'lords.'\"<!--\n              -->\"Why do those social occasions you mentioned sound like some resale market?\"<!--\n              -->\"And why would it not? The attendees are the same old faces. Friends might be second-hand, dance partners too, and antiques likewise. And grand gestures are not necessarily needed to acquire treasure. One could bet on how many rounds it might take for a person to get drunk, and win an item from some collection for betting well.\"<!--\n              -->\"And what would that reward be?\"<!--\n              -->\"Who knows? People tend to see only what they wish to, and everyone names different prizes. However, the day prior, someone claimed that his ancestor had once attended the Deepwinter Cocktail Ball — quite the distant event, that. He then made a bet with a noble lord of the fae who had little interest in the party, wagering that a dancer would get drunk before they had emptied their fifth cup. He won, and thus obtained a gem from said noble lord, who rather admired those of keen intellect.\"<!--\n              -->As he spoke, Flins gestured for Illuga to look at his palm. A brilliant ice-blue gemstone lay there.<!--\n              -->\"...I'm guessing you just received this.\"<!--\n              -->\"What a fine piece of merchandise it is.\"<!--\n              -->\"Call me an overthinker, but I get the feeling that your pile of stories is being prepared for second-hand resale at some point.\"<!--\n              -->\"Dear me, no. I would not sell it for money, no matter how dire our organization's financial straits. In any case, I doubt it rates too high in your eyes, Young Master.\"<!--\n              -->\"If it were so valuable, would that noble truly have given it away? Or are you suggesting that the fae nobles of Snezhnaya were so high-minded that they would all accept defeat with grace?\"<!--\n              -->\"Hard to say, I fear. But a noble who valiantly honors their word could never have been too evil.\" Having said this much, Flins gestured toward the inside of the door. \"I really should bring that bucket over, Young Master. You look like the phantom of one who died of thirst.\""

                "text": "If you were curious and observed all this, you would inevitably wonder... Was Flins telling the truth? The answer is no. But when asked if he was lying, the answer would, surprisingly, also be no. That which he spoke of, rather than a lie, should be considered a legend of which not all was told. For protagonists of legend, though marvelous in deed, did not always leave behind names.<!--\n              -->Let us return first to the time of the Belyi Tsar and that ball. The fae noble who showed little interest in the banquet and ultimately gave the jewel away on the pretext of losing a bet was named Kyryll Chudomirovich Flins. The recipient was Sokolov, a complete nobody from southern Snezhnaya, whose descendants would later become members of the Adventurers' Guild. The only connection between the two wholly unrelated parties was the \"Tear of the North,\" said to have been formed from the courage of Snezhnayan soldiers fighting in the northern territories, capable of protecting its bearer. Kyryll received it in the days when the Tsar bestowed many gifts upon the nobles, and after he gave it away, Kyryll himself vanished without a trace.<!--\n              -->Local legends have it that the noble who vanished — Kyryll the Azure Flame — was originally a blue flame that guided fallen souls across the icy plains. A flame will eventually go out, and while Kyryll did not stay at court for long, he was present for the transition of power from the Belyi Tsar to the Tsaritsa. There are only so many reasons for his departure: Dissatisfaction with the Tsar, or with the Tsaritsa, or perhaps he said something he shouldn't have and was purged for it. Some even say that his disappearance has nothing to do with politics. That his fire simply went out, having reached the end of its natural lifespan, and thus was never seen again. Not everything has to do with politics, so such people say. Could anyone put a number on the happenings at court, in any case?<!--\n              -->Kyryll Chudomirovich Flins's family crest and surname remain in the register of Snezhnayan nobility. He once was a member of the royal court, but never had any followers of his own. Gradually, the flames of Snezhnaya were completely replaced by red ones, and the regions that once enshrined blue flames also fell one by one. People eventually accepted the red flames burning across the icy plains, just as they accepted the new regime.<!--\n              -->Flins the Ratnik had once heard these tales of Kyryll. He clapped his hands, praising the mystifying atmosphere that had to be created to set the stage for a legendary tale, claiming that hearing interesting stories was one of his driving motivations for collecting ancient coins and gems. He has never been stingy with showcasing his collection, and indeed, Nikita, chief of the Lightkeepers, has had the fortune of viewing it before. But Flins often says that the collector's hobby is not expensive. People think so because they only see the shocking prices the most famous gems fetch, without realizing that those are the rarest of specimens — the vast majority command no such great sums.<!--\n              -->Take the \"Tear of the North\" from the story, for instance, which happened to be in Flins's possession — a happy coincidence, of course. It was beautifully transparent, yes, but it lost out to a still more storied gemstone due to its lack of added value. The recipient, Sokolov, had considered selling it, but couldn't get a good price. The gem had then passed through who knows how many generations before finally fetching a decent sum.<!--\n              -->As for Kyryll, the noble repeatedly mentioned in the tale... Well, were there ever such a noble, he most likely departed due to displeasure with the regime change. Where he had gone was of little importance to the people of this world. Legend has it, after all, that Snezhnayans held no one to be indispensable save the Tsar and Tsaritsa in those days. So if Kyryll were at divergence with some policy or another, departure was perhaps his best option."

                "text": "Time slows to a crawl during the night watch. With nothing else to do, the Ratniki guarding the camp gradually developed a habit of passing the time with cards and chess. When Flins came to submit a report to the sergeant major, he happened upon comrades of his gathered together, not yet asleep. He stood at the side and watched, a look of great interest on his face. After more than an hour, his colleagues finally noticed someone in the darkness besides them. After recovering from their shock, they decided that their lighthouse-keeper colleague must not be skilled at cards and enthusiastically offered to teach him over a few rounds. Flins played the part every well-mannered, reserved card game novice should — first declining, then taking a seat at the table, performing curiosity and restraint with utmost authenticity.<!--\n              -->Although the Ratniki invited him to play, they had no intention of going easy on him. As far as they were concerned, it was perfectly normal for a newcomer to lose a few rounds at the card table. However, what happened next was quite strange. Whether novice or veteran, everyone seemed to lose their sense of judgment that night. Their battle set the scoreboard ablaze, deadlock reigning over all as the game dragged on.<!--\n              -->This Flins was a fine fellow Ratnik, certainly, but how could he hold out for so long without losing? The veterans frowned, quietly gathering behind him to peek at his hand. But at that moment, Flins, his mask of sincerity flawless, played two somewhat subpar cards even as he praised card games for \"testing one's tactical acumen.\"<!--\n              -->At this point, his colleagues finally breathed a sigh of relief. He'd lost! Well, losing to Olav was no surprise. But he'd played decently earlier. Could it be that he wasn't a beginner after all? Who were his usual card game partners in that case? The frogs, stones, and spirits lingering by the lighthouse?<!--\n              -->Flins stood up to shake hands with his opponent, the apologetic look on his face seeming far from feigned: \"Mr. Olav, I accept my defeat wholeheartedly. Your card skills are truly remarkable, and although this was just one game, your spirit and demeanor speak for themselves. If you ask me, it's already a great honor that you were willing to play against a novice like me.\"<!--\n              -->\"Really?\" Olav happily stepped forward and firmly shook his hand. \"That wasn't an easy win, I must say. Your luck was truly formidable.\"<!--\n              -->\"How else could I have survived until now?\" Flins spoke subtly, with just a hint of sorrow in his words. Everyone then recalled that brutal battle, and they patted him on the shoulder, comforting this brother who must surely have once had to mourn his fallen comrades alone in the dead of night.<!--\n              -->\"Brother, take this deck of cards with you. We'll keep a seat for you, too — come back and play with us when you have time,\" his colleagues said.<!--\n              -->\"I'm afraid this pastime does not entirely agree with me.\" Flins smiled politely, but accepted the gift nonetheless.<!--\n              -->He stayed quite late that night, and when he left the next day, a misty pink hue hovered on the horizon. Olav saw him off, and there they happened to run into Nikita and Illuga, who were returning to camp after completing their mission. Flins stopped beside them with his lantern, nodding respectfully.<!--\n              -->Nikita glanced at Olav and understood at once: \"Played cards together, did you?\"<!--\n              -->\"Indeed. Just joining in the fun, you see. I was given a deck of cards, too — would you be up for a game, Illuga?\"<!--\n              -->\"Next time at the lighthouse, probably.\" Illuga smiled. \"You know, Dad was just saying he hasn't seen you in a while, by the by.\"<!--\n              -->Nikita suddenly asked Flins, \"Did you learn anything?\" Standing off to the side, Illuga thought this question was abrupt, yet interesting. What could a card game reveal? Had Olav been slacking off? In his mind, Flins, who had never been the sneaky sort, was suddenly more mysterious than any ghost. How could there be a Ratnik who had never played cards before?<!--\n              -->Flins lifted his lantern, the blue flame illuminating Olav's face. For the first time, Olav suddenly found something strange: The flame in Flins's lantern had always been cold blue, yet he had never seen anyone else purchase a similar one. What kind of fuel did Flins use?<!--\n              -->\"Mr. Olav, I believe, is a most patient and composed gentleman. He never once complained about my slow card play, and I suspect he's quite the skilled hand in the field. Using stillness to overcome movement, steadily achieving victory... Such traits surely manifest beyond the realm of card games.\"<!--\n              -->Ah, Olav thought, deeply moved. Surely Flins meant what he said — a dab hand at identifying others' strengths, indeed.<!--\n              -->Nikita looked at Olav earnestly, bringing to his mind the last time they had such a conversation. They had been discussing work assignments, and Nikita had suggested that he take up the challenge of becoming a squad leader.<!--\n              -->\"Even someone who's only played one game of cards with you says so, Olav. You should have more trust in my judgment, no?\" Nikita said.<!--\n              -->A comical situation often arises when many people discuss the same thing, where those who know each other too well are, in fact, less likely to adopt each other's suggestions wholesale. At such times, an unfamiliar voice's interjection can simplify matters. This was one such moment — for Olav now grew in confidence. Nikita was right, surely. Why wouldn't he be an excellent tactician? After all, even Flins, distant as he was at his lighthouse posting, could see that.<!--\n              -->Nikita visited the lighthouse a few days later. He had come specifically to thank Flins. Olav had always lacked that last bit of courage needed to push forward, and Flins's loss at cards had proved most fortuitous.<!--\n              -->\"You did me a favor.\" Nikita brought him some supplies. \"Take these. Even if you don't need them, they can help you keep up the pretense.\"<!--\n              -->\"Pretending might just become my favorite thing to do.\" Flins took out the cards his colleagues had given him. \"Interested?\"<!--\n              -->The card game proved a drawn-out affair. Nikita struggled mightily, while Flins was clearly enjoying himself.<!--\n              -->\"I hope my gratitude is evident. I mean, I'm even playing against a former noble in a card game his people excelled at.\" Nikita smiled wryly. \"Which is harder, then? Winning at cards or pretending you can't win?\"<!--\n              -->\"Both are easier than pretending to be an ordinary person.\" Flins played a card. \"Sorry, I win again.\""

The person himself is most pleased with this name and has used it in various ways up till the present.<!--\n              -->The noble Kyryll did indeed leave Snezhnaya. The wise believe that there is nothing new under the sun, and tales of nobles choosing self-imposed exile when powerless to change the political picture are old hat indeed. To say that Kyryll has lived twice is no boast either. If one views sleep as death, and awakening as new life gained... This, too, is nothing new.<!--\n              -->His slumber began in a corner of a distant land. His self-imposed exile had set him free, and having lost his anchor, he traveled southward along the railway, through endless snowy plains, through prosperous towns, and across desolate frontier lands. He was without a care — he had no destination, nor anything he had to do.<!--\n              -->The humans passing him by were quite the opposite. As latecomers to Snezhnaya, they had too many desires to fulfill in a few mere decades of life. They were always in a hurry, planning out better lives and hoping to achieve great things in this new era. But Kyryll had long felt that he might not belong to such a time.<!--\n              -->It was under the lighthouse on a small isle that Kyryll the Azure Flame found his destined tomb, though one might also call it a bed to his liking, or a most lovable coffin. He had never intended to end his own life, merely to casually toast this monotonous world once, then go to sleep. He recalled the cocktail parties of yesteryear, of his noble colleagues gathering to discuss some passe questions. At the time, most fae lamented the transfer of imperial power, and wished for some river of youth springing eternal that might preserve the authority of Snezhnayan imperium forevermore.<!--\n              -->They spoke of immortality and eternity with longing and envy in their voices, much like how humans would discuss their fae lives. Kyryll was unsure as to how he had responded then, but he might have said: \"To never again fear anything — how could such serenity possibly exist within the confines of a finite life?\"<!--\n              -->Atop a stone altar, Kyryll transformed into a ball of fire and sank beneath the earth, beginning a slumber that would last hundreds of years. As his eyes closed, a thought suddenly came to mind: If he never returned to the mortal realm, and instead stretched himself infinitely within his finite time through self-imposed exile, then this sleep would become eternity. Hah. Eternity, precious beyond price, found by one who had cast himself out. Imagine that.<!--\n              -->Kyryll's slumber was no trivial matter. He made thorough preparations for it, selecting stone slates and laying down an altar, sealing himself in using the most ancient rituals. No mean price would it take to reawakening this flame, and its location, rarely visited by humans, made it less likely to be disturbed. However, this foolproof tranquility, this death-like slumber, ultimately vanished in the thunder of a rainy night.<!--\n              -->The soft sound of blood splattering upon the paving, the dull noise of metal cutting through flesh, the din of sharpened claws piercing bodies and striking against stone slates... Kyryll could not help but be awakened. Though hundreds of years had passed, his hearing remained as sharp as ever.<!--\n              -->Above his resting place, a unit of those named Lightkeepers battled the Abyssal Wild Hunt. Newly awakened from his deep slumber, Kyryll was indifferent to this. Not a single tongue of outer flame flickered. Had he been in human form, he would not have been seen to lift even an eyelid.<!--\n              -->That was a moment the Snezhnayan rumors mocked. \"Souls wandering the ancient frozen earth shall ultimately be guided to the far shore by blue ghost-fires.\" Even with his eyes closed, Kyryll could witness that scene: Warm human blood seeping into the stone altar, like some grand and ancient ritual. A mortally wounded warrior, collapsing upon the sacrificial sanctum and tracing the symbols on the stone slate with fresh blood. The warrior understood nothing of the fae script written upon it, nor could a person at death's door confirm if the lifeline before them was timely come or not. So with his final breath, he prayed, beseeching any who could hear to descend upon this place and scatter the storm-cloud of death and despair rolling toward them.<!--\n              -->Kyryll must have smiled at that moment. The fears the nobles harbored had, in the end, borne fruit. How could such a lasting dream exist in this world? Blood and souls had paid the price, and the azure flame was now reawakened. This should have been a grand, glorious moment, but the moribund supplicant knew it now, nor the distant monsters or the deceased. Indeed, most who would recognize that blazing fire had themselves passed on long ago. Such was the end of Kyryll's slumber, of which he had expected much, in this silent place of death.<!--\n              -->A colossal blaze scorched the skies as it erupted from the small island.<!--\n              -->How could serenity possibly exist within the confines of a finite life? Only death, glimpsed through the blue flames, is real."

                "text": "The young Ratnik Illuga encountered the mysterious Mr. Flins while following orders from Starshyna Nikita to conduct business in Nasha Town. Flins had a brilliant gemstone pinned to his solemn, dark outer clothing, an all too eye-catching accessory in that tiny shop. Illuga's first glance thus fell not on the man himself, but on the gem.<!--\n              -->\"Mr. Flins, you must have quite a sum in savings. Otherwise, such a gem must've been hard come by indeed.\"<!--\n              -->\"Oh, this? I got it at an auction. It just looks pretty. Remember the story I told you? Some gems are all show and no substance — they can't fetch a high price at all.\"<!--\n              -->\"Did no one bid against you?\"<!--\n              -->\"Well, most people don't know a good thing when they see it, for which I am grateful. There'd be no need for me to attend auctions otherwise, I suspect.\"<!--\n              -->\"Well, all the less reason to believe you don't have savings. Might you have had a distant relative who left you a large sum of money?\"<!--\n              -->Flins's face grew grave. \"I hope you can keep this a secret, good sir. This must not be revealed to anyone, especially to our colleagues.\"<!--\n              -->Being kind-hearted by nature, especially in front of others, Illuga felt proud to keep his colleague's secret and readily agreed. However, months later, Illuga found himself quite troubled by the sense that he had been completely taken for a ride. The city auction house claimed that they had never seen a gem of that description before, and that Flins had not attended one of their events in quite some time.<!--\n              -->\"You spun me a yarn, didn't you, Mr. Flins? The auction house says that they haven't had any fine gems come in recently.\"<!--\n              -->Flins raised his pot of water. \"First, have a little water to cool your temper. I never expected you to go ask around.\"<!--\n              -->\"Should I say that you consider me a friend, or that you don't... Either way, not every secret shared is the truth.\"<!--\n              -->\"Is it gemstones you'd like, then? Perhaps my distant relatives still have some in stock.\"<!--\n              -->\"I'd like to give my old pops Nikita a valuable gift. He's taken good care of me since I was little, you see,\" Illuga confessed.<!--\n              -->\"Now, that might take some time, but I suspect you will obtain something similarly good sooner or later. Having distant relatives come forth with gifts... That sort of thing will likely happen to you, too.\"<!--\n              -->Thus it was that Flins shared the true origin of the Moon Wheel with a cup of water and moonlight at night, a thing he rarely did. It had come to him on a night like any other, appearing suddenly in his showroom. At first, he, like Illuga that day, believed that this might be some gemstone he had forgotten about. In truth, it was the best gift the world had ever given him.<!--\n              -->\"An unexpected gift,\" indeed. Its style perfectly matched his coat, provided the perfect cover for his power and flames, and served as a conversation piece to share with colleagues as the sun set.<!--\n              -->As to whether Illuga believed his words, or when he might gain a \"gemstone\" of his own... Well, that was up to this up-and-coming young fellow to figure out — slowly does it, and all that."
