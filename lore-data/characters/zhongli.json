Handsome, elegant, and surpassingly learned.\nThough no one knows where Zhongli is from, he is a master of courtesy and rules. His grasp of Liyue's traditions is superior to that of any scholar. From his seat at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, he performs all manner of rituals. Proper clothing, auspicious timing, locations and appliances, observances and regulations, all such things can be left in his hands without a care.\nBut though he is a man of such particularity, he never has a Mora to his name. Trade requires capital, and transport demands payment, and yet Zhongli has no such thing on him &mdash; for in the end, someone else will always foot the bill.\nHe will attend the most celebrated performances, and be accompanied by the loveliest thrushes. His behavior is immaculate in every way, save for the matter of money. Those around him have long gotten used to his eccentricities, and do not take this matter to heart. If you ask him, he will say: \"Is that so? I don't recall anyone ever taking issue with me concerning money.\"\nMoney for goods &mdash; that is the norm. How could someone living in this world not comprehend its fundamental truths?\nHas the passage of too many years eroded his sense of mortal trivialities? Or does he see his voyage through this world as though it were a stroll amongst the clouds?"

                "text": "In Liyue's traditional customs, \"receiving adepti\" and \"sending adepti off\" are equally important.The Hus of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, who have been in this business for 77 generations, are the masters of handling funerals. However, Hu Tao, the current owner of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, primarily focuses on the art of sending mortals on their way.For the various ceremonies for sending adepti off, Hu Tao usually employs the help of a friend in more or less the same business. That person's name is Zhongli. The adepti have been with Liyue for millennia, but only a handful have ascended in the past three thousand years, which means that everything regarding the traditions now only exists in texts. This is not something one would likely witness twice in their entire lifetime.Not even the most particular and learned of researchers or scholars could find one fault in Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's ceremonies for sending adepti off.Everything must be perfect, from the costumes, the time, the place, the items, the weather, the scheduled length, the size of the permitted audience, to the stature, profession, and age of said audience. Nothing can be overlooked.When folk describe Zhongli as \"living history,\" the latter usually only smiles and sighs.\"I... just have a good memory.\""

Some people hate spicy food, others don't eat fish, and some want their tofu served sweet...But as for Zhongli, he is particular about everything.He attends operas performed by only the most celebrated stars, takes only the most luxuriant thrushes out for walks, and he goes into the kitchen personally to instruct the cooks as to the ratio of shrimp and fish required to make the most authentic Fullmoon Egg.Zhongli has expertise in all manner of things, from fashion to daily essentials, to fine wines and delicacies, to teas and spices, and to flora and fauna. He is also more than capable of participating in discussions on commerce, politics, and international relations.But on a typical day, all you will glean from him is a few pieces of useless trivia, because he particularly enjoys sharing these fun tidbits with you."

No matter what high heavens the store owner praises their product to, no matter its ancient history or classical value, prices are always flexible. Half the stated cost is a good place to start.But when Zhongli pays up (or rather, calls for someone else to pay up on his behalf), he never looks at the price tag. As long as it catches his eye, Zhongli will pay as much as the owner asks. Indeed, he will even buy it at a premium sometimes.But for some reason, Zhongli always forgets to bring money.For small purchases, he has friends to help him out, and large bills he somehow finds ways to have written off.To those merchants who secretly pride themselves on their powers of flattery, Zhongli is a man of strange proclivities: in truth, he knows a great deal about the value of money and finance, and he also understands the suffering of the people. However, he seems to not understand that poverty is part of the human condition.Or perhaps it might be said that he cannot imagine himself being poor.How has such a person not died of hunger yet?"

The Seven Nations and the world itself are where his efforts are directed.As for wealth... He is wealth itself.He is Morax, the overlord Rex Lapis who rules Liyue, and the Geo Archon of the Seven Archons. The very money that circulates throughout Teyvat, Mora, is named after him.When night falls and bustling Liyue begins to slumber, he will sometimes stand atop the towering mountains and gaze upon this city, which he made with his own hands.To the people of Liyue, Rex Lapis has many divine titles.When he laid down Liyue's laws by his divine might, he was the God of Contracts. When he minted the first Mora and made Liyue strong by dint of commerce, the merchants revered him as the God of Commerce.He has lived through countless years and is the eldest of the Seven, and so historians call him the God of History.Thousands of years ago, the forebears of the citizens of Liyue Harbor struck stones together to start fires and used piled stones to create stoves. These blessings derived from the Geo element led the Geo Archon to gain the title of God of the Stove.People from other lands tend to call him Morax, though the people of Liyue prefer to use the term Rex Lapis.But in the hearts of lovers of opera and children, Morax's on-stage aspect, the all-conquering defender of Liyue — the Warrior God — is the most fascinating.The delicacies that Rex Lapis discovered while lost in the streets, the plaques inscribed with his handwriting, a famous opera that he once starred in, playing the part of a warrior... Many stories and tales of Liyue are, when studied closely, stories of people visited by their deity at some point — and the citizens of Liyue are most proud indeed of that history."

Only a refined and strict order can sustain vibrant commerce, which is itself the lifeblood of Liyue Harbor.Thus the Qixing punish violators of such laws unceasingly, not only to uphold the divine rulings of Morax but also to allow Liyue to maintain its vitality.Through the millennia, every generation of the Liyue Qixing commits to interpreting the law, including subtle amendments to plug loopholes found in the law. Any loopholes that remain undiscovered are seen by the merchants as \"permissible if unaddressed,\" and they make killings off such holes until they are discovered and patched up by the Liyue Qixing.Amid this game of cat-and-mouse, the book that collates such amendments has reached a whopping 279 pages thick.The person currently responsible for maintaining this book, the Tianquan Ningguang, is secretly (and humorously) referred to as the \"Tailor of Liyue,\" in honor of her speed in patching these laws up, and for her sharpness of eye.But no matter how complicated or tangled mortal laws become, one of these stands above all others in the eyes of Rex Lapis.\"The one who reneges on their words shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock.\""

The Seven were a diverse lot and dispersed far and wide, but they all shouldered the burden of guiding humanity.As time passed, many of The Seven's titles changed hands, and only two remain of the first Seven: Rex Lapis and the Anemo Archon.The carefree Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, is the second eldest of The Seven.When Barbatos first came to Liyue, Rex Lapis believed his fellow archon to have encountered some terrible crisis in pursuit of their duties, thus requiring his aid.So when Barbatos descended in a gust of wind, the Geo Archon had already prepared himself to receive this neighboring deity and lend what help he may.But as he looked, the Anemo Archon tossed a wine bottle at him.\"Here's some wine from Mondstadt. Care for a taste?\"To forsake one's duty to deliver a single bottle of wine — what a preposterous notion!Yet the Anemo Archon kept coming to visit, to explore Liyue Harbor, all sorts of strange questions on his lips. The Anemo Archon's questions knew as little limits as the wine in his hands.From then on, the first Seven would often gather in Liyue.Rex Lapis still remembers how those wines tasted.The world has changed much since then, and all that was once familiar has faded into memory.The seven seats changed and again were changed, till five of the seven at the table were all departed.Nor would the duty of guiding humanity be honored by the new archons.Even the hardest rocks may be worn down after three thousand years.Nor would the wind ever return again.One drizzly day, the ancient ruler was strolling about Liyue Harbor, and overheard a merchant telling one of his workers,\"You've finished your duties, go ahead and call it a day.\"Long did he stand amidst the milling crowd.\"Have I... already finished my duties?\""

Not only did gods fight amongst themselves, but countless wicked things also sought to expand their domains.One such type of creature caused no end of woe for the Geo Archon, long before he took that title along with his place among The Seven.These foul creatures, straight from the murky depths of the ocean abyss, had a squishy exterior, and possessed agile tentacles that would live on even after being cut off, even secreting some thick and revolting fluid in the process.This alone would have been enough to make them the most monstrous of all creatures, and still it was not the pinnacle of their monstrosity.What made them so truly terrible was their small size, which gave them the ability to duck into unimaginably small nooks and crannies.No space was too narrow for them, neither the wooden boards of tables and chairs, nor the seams of windows and doors and curtain folds, nor even books and brushes.Many a poor soul had, on at least one occasion, unwittingly outstretched their hand, only to quickly retract it in horror with a blood-curdling scream at the sensation of something cold, clammy and damp, while one or more of these despicable creatures came crawling up their arm, leaving a shiny trail behind them...At the behest of the people of Liyue, Morax agreed to wipe these creatures out. But these parasites upon civilization could not be destroyed like enemies on a battlefield, by simply summoning a storm of stone spears that would shatter the earth and churn the soil{{sic|....|hide=1}}Still, he was the God of Contracts. His word had to be his bond.So, he went through the town from house to house with prisons of stone, seizing these creatures one by one and locking them away for good...This long campaign of pest extermination taught Morax the true meaning of \"a burden lifted.\"The grueling campaign itself, and the terrible smell of those ocean creatures' secretions, left a lasting impression on the deity.Today, even when he goes out incognito as the mortal man, Zhongli, Morax gives those living, squirming seafood products a wide berth....Well, except for dishes where said seafood products have been sliced and diced into oblivion, such as seafood tofu.

Though {{zh|先生|xiānshēng}} is now normally only used for men, similar to \"Mr.\" in English, in ancient times it's used as a respectful address for accomplished or influential individuals, similar to {{ja|先生|sensei}} in Japanese.\n** '''About Tartaglia: Composed:''' In Chinese, Zhongli calls Tartaglia {{zh|武人|wǔrén}} instead of \"rascal,\" which is a general term for any martial artist.\n** '''Chat: Reminiscing:''' In Chinese, the first sentence Zhongli recites is from a [https://baike.baidu.com/item/唐多令·芦叶满汀洲/8464037 Chinese poem]: \"{{zh|欲买桂花同载酒}}\". The direct translation of this line is \"[I] wish to buy {{w|Osmanthus fragrans|osmanthus}} and drink wine together.\" The poem continues with \"{{zh|终不似，少年游}}\", meaning: \"In the end, it cannot be [carefree] like the journeys of my youth.\" Zhongli says instead, \"{{zh|只可惜故人，何日再见呢？}}\", which roughly means: \"It's only a pity I know not when I can see that old friend again.\"\n** '''About Xiao:''' In Chinese, {{zh|连理镇心散}} is used instead of \"painkillers.\" This fictional medicine is based on {{zh|镇心散}}, a traditional Chinese medicine for clearing the mind and relieving emotional pain, commonly used to treat symptoms such as postpartum depression in new mothers.\n* In the Japanese version, one of his voice lines (\"Chat: Reminiscing\") was updated twice.\n\n==Navigation==\n{{Character Navbox|VO}}\n\nes:Zhongli/Voz\nfr:Zhongli/Répliques\nit:Zhongli/Battute\nja:鍾離/ボイス/英語\npl:Zhongli/Kwestie dialogowe\npt-br:Zhongli/Falas\nru:Чжун Ли/Озвучка\nth:Zhongli/เสียงพากย์\ntr:Zhongli/Replikler"
