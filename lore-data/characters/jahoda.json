                "text": "Day after day, amidst all the noise and mishaps, the people of Nasha Town have grown thoroughly familiar with the one and only official employee of the Curatorium of Secrets: Miss Jahoda.\nSometimes she struts out of the Curatorium with all the self-importance in the world, bounding through the streets just to buy herself an extra-large sugar sculpture. Sometimes she springs furiously across rooftops, chasing down a client who tried to scam her. Other times, she'll slump by the Curatorium's front steps, head bowed, motionless as Ashru plays with her undone braids...\nMany have posed the same question to Lady Nefer: In a town so full of rare gifts and inquisitive minds, why place your faith in a girl so ordinary — perhaps even a touch clumsy?\nNefer's reply never changes:\n\"At any rate, just trust my judgement.\"\nHowever, on especially awful days, even Jahoda will ask feebly, with her head hanging low:\n\"Boss Nef... There's no chance you'll fire me suddenly, right...?\"\n\"Why would I do that? If you're gone, who's going to feed Ashru and refill his water?\"\n\"Really...? That's the reason? But...\"\n\"Ah! Ashru! You little rascal, get off! That braid took me forever!\"\n\"Meow-meow, meow–!\"\nNefer leans her chin against her hand, watching the girl and the cat in their usual tangle of play and fuss.\nShe knows Jahoda will continue to grow. That one day, Jahoda will learn to navigate every rocky patch and treacherous storm, and steer her own life with a steady hand.\nAnd when that time comes, the girl who began with nothing but herself will have to face the question: Where does her path truly lead?\nTo Nefer, it's a \"question\" interesting enough to observe.\nTo Jahoda, it's an \"answer\" important enough to chase after."

There's no chance you'll fire me, right...?\"<!--\n              -->\"How could I?\" her dear boss replied with a gentle smile. \"If you were gone, who would brush Ashru's fur, fill his bowl, or make sure your boss here got a good night's sleep?\"<!--\n              -->\"W&ndash;What?

Sometimes, it was a job that hadn't gone smoothly. And sometimes... it was the curiosity she couldn't contain.<!--\n              -->Noisy crowds were easy enough to handle. The boss had told Jahoda that if she wanted everyone to quiet down, all she had to do was grab whatever was at hand — a cup, a plate, even a chair — and throw it into the crowd while yelling at everyone to be quiet.<!--\n              -->Jahoda had tried it, and it really worked. She'd leap out of bed, snatch up a stuffed toy, and hurl it out the window, then shout at the top of her lungs. And the thieves outside, staggering around, yelling and drinking, would actually fall silent. After that, Jahoda would mess with her tangled hair, hug her blanket, and flop back into bed. Meanwhile, everyone below would be trying not to laugh as they watched the unlucky one who had been hit by the toy. This time, it was his turn to wash it and sneak it back to Jahoda's bedside, or else their little lady would wake up in a sulk the next morning.<!--\n              -->A job that didn't go well could leave Jahoda feeling down for a long time. When it got too much, she would slip out of the house and quietly wake Zinaida. Half-asleep, Zinaida would listen as Jahoda mumbled that she'd lost her keys because there were just too many of them in the house, and they all looked the same. Next time, she promised herself, she'd color-code every key... that would solve the problem for sure.<!--\n              -->\"And remember that time I accidentally fell off the roof and landed right in front of the boss? He was in the middle of negotiating with a rival. So... why did I hand him the apple I was holding? Well... because the boss had been talking for so long, he must've been thirsty! And I only had one apple, so of course it had to go to him. What was I supposed to do, give it to the rival? I mean, sorry... I guess I'll bring two next time...\"<!--\n              -->Jahoda would ramble on until she finally fell asleep, resting her head on Zinaida's shoulder. Zinaida, having seen this countless times, would carry her back to the house, tuck her into bed, and set a glass of water on the nightstand, knowing that after all that talking, she'd be thirsty in the morning.<!--\n              -->Of course, the hardest to quiet was her occasional bursts of curiosity.<!--\n              -->And sometimes, to calm that curiosity... she had to take a few risks."

                "text": "As Jahoda grew a bit older, some Seahook Gang members would occasionally have restless nights.<!--\n              -->Sometimes it was from drinking too much, sometimes from injuries, and sometimes simply because they didn't feel like sleeping.<!--\n              -->But there was only one time when the entire gang stayed up all night.<!--\n              -->After a certain \"business deal,\" the gang held a feast to celebrate their victory. That black-hearted merchant had finally gotten his comeuppance, handing over all the money he'd swindled. After returning the victims' share, everyone in the gang was guaranteed a nice cut.<!--\n              -->At one point during the chaos, when someone reached for a necklace, the merchant had suddenly lunged, almost possessed, trying to snatch it back. He was too frail, though, and the gang easily subdued him.<!--\n              -->What followed was the same old cliché they'd seen a thousand times. The swindler started bawling, swearing he'd give up everything if they'd just return the pendant. According to him, it held the only picture left of his wife and daughter.<!--\n              -->These experienced thieves, of course, weren't fooled. Nine out of ten swindlers they'd tied up would use the same excuse to beg for something back, and that \"something\" usually hid a clue to some treasure, a way for them to crawl back from rock bottom. After tossing the merchant a bit of money, the gang headed straight back to their base.<!--\n              -->But just as everyone had eaten and drunk their fill, and it had come time to divvy up the spoils...<!--\n              -->\"Wait... Where's Jahoda? She was just here...\"<!--\n              -->\"Boss, that necklace is gone! C—Could it be...?\"<!--\n              -->Jahoda had disappeared. And with her went the necklace — neither too expensive nor too cheap, but enough to cause a stir.<!--\n              -->Silence swept through the hall. The seasoned thieves glanced at one another. None of them believed Jahoda would betray them over some random necklace. Besides, Jahoda probably didn't even know what the word \"betrayal\" meant.<!--\n              -->At last, Zinaida spoke up, hesitant and uncertain.<!--\n              -->\"She wouldn't... really have gone to return that necklace, would she...?\"<!--\n              -->Before she even finished, a small door at the back of the hall creaked open. Jahoda slowly poked her head out. But instead of sneaking back into the noisy, crowded room she'd imagined, she froze at the heavy silence that greeted her.<!--\n              -->\"S—Sorry... I... I was just in the bathroom...\"<!--\n              -->The first weary sigh came from the boss, his face buried in his hands. The second came from Zinaida, now certain she'd guessed right. One sigh after another followed, filling the hall, while Jahoda lingered at the doorway, still peeking in, unsure whether she should step inside.<!--\n              -->\"Jahoda, dear, come here.\"<!--\n              -->The boss beckoned to the girl, who was fresh off finishing a secret little adventure.<!--\n              -->\"We're deducting the cost of that necklace from your share, so you'll get nothing this time.\"<!--\n              -->\"B—But that necklace... Huh? Wh—What necklace? I have no idea what you're talking about! I...\"<!--\n              -->\"Jahoda.\"<!--\n              -->\"Yes, Boss!\"<!--\n              -->\"Quiet.

It could hire members of the Seahook Gang to take out their own boss, throwing the troublesome gang into disarray. It could buy barrels of oil to burn away all the evidence and scare off the faint-hearted. And most importantly, it could be used to buy valuable intelligence from that mysterious businesswoman.<!--\n              -->The hidden powers that once controlled Nasha Town were gone, leaving only money as the path to power.<!--\n              -->But the hunter who had set his sights on him didn't need it.<!--\n              -->\"Enough! Show yourself! What do you want from me!?\"<!--\n              -->The burly man bellowed into the silent forest. His camp had just been raided again. Somehow, the small, wiry assassin had slipped inside, effortlessly taking down one guard after another. She had pierced three warning drums with her arrows and even reached the very center of the camp. If she hadn't stumbled from the roof in her weakened state, Ratfan's head would already have been separated from his body. Yet even after taking two arrows and a hammer blow, she had still dashed back into the forest, disappearing without a trace. And just like countless nights before, she would return the next night, always managing to track Ratfan no matter where he fled.<!--\n              -->Exhaustion and fear had everyone on edge. Some said the girl had long since died, and that what kept returning was merely her spirit, driven by obsession. Others said she had devolved into a member of the Wild Hunt, and that only the Ratniki could stop her now.<!--\n              -->But Ratfan knew the truth: she was just a little girl. He had seen Jahoda when he scouted the Seahook Gang before, and even the gang's boss had praised her highly.<!--\n              -->Back then, Jahoda was a slight and ingenuous kid. When she stood below with the others, she would secretly tug at her companion's hand, swaying back and forth, only calming down after a gentle tap on the head. She had looked nothing like a thief. By any measure, she still had a long way to grow, or perhaps, she didn't even know what form she wanted to shape herself into.<!--\n              -->Now Ratfan knew he had been wrong. Jahoda didn't need time to grow — she just needed a reason.<!--\n              -->And he had given her that reason with his own hands.<!--\n              -->—So be it, then. They would settle this in the way thieves knew best.<!--\n              -->Another night, Ratfan had torches planted all around the camp, and he stood alone in the center, weapon in hand.<!--\n              -->He couldn't even remember the last time he had held a weapon himself. The sword felt impossibly heavy, heavier than a bag stuffed full of Mora.<!--\n              -->As expected, his opponent appeared, calmly stepping into the obvious trap.<!--\n              -->The torches lit up Jahoda's face, gaunt from hunger. A lingering fever had drained all color from her skin, and her hair clung to her cheeks like withered grass. Her lips were cracked like parched earth, yet her eyes still shone, bright, sharp, and unyielding. It was as if she had struck a bargain with death itself, her soul burning with a fierce vitality that would last until her vengeance was complete.<!--\n              -->Jahoda was a lone gambler, and her life was her final chip.<!--\n              -->Since she had nothing to lose, why not go all in?<!--\n              -->\"Kid... let's talk, alright? Whatever you want, I can give it to you, just name it.\"<!--\n              -->Ratfan swallowed hard, the bravery he'd scraped together already slipping away.<!--\n              -->He knew those eyes too well. They belonged to a desperate soul.<!--\n              -->\"I—I know you're a good person, Jahoda...\"<!--\n              -->Jahoda had nothing. But he had so much — money, jewels, gold, wealth, luxury, all waiting for him.<!--\n              -->\"L—Listen to me, don't do anything reckless... we can...\"<!--\n              -->But Jahoda didn't need any of it.<!--\n              -->She had already sunk her teeth into her prey."

I suppose you're right...\"<!--\n              -->And so, adorned with a cyan glass sphere out of nowhere provided by her Boss, Jahoda continued her busy life as usual.<!--\n              -->Just as Nefer predicted, people's attitudes improved noticeably once they learned Jahoda had a Vision. Not only were remunerations given to her slightly higher, but she was also entrusted with more challenging commissions...<!--\n              -->Of course, the high pay, difficulty, and expectations weighed heavily on Jahoda, who knew full well she had no real Vision. This pressure made her work even harder, spinning like a little top all day long. But overall, she found genuine joy in being more useful, earning more, and finally earning some trust.<!--\n              -->Even in her dreams, she often found herself aiding others or achieving great feats.<!--\n              -->\"Don't... don't worry, I have... a Vision...\"<!--\n              -->She mumbled, flailing her fists as if she'd just defeated some formidable foe in her sleep.<!--\n              -->In reality, having just returned from a nighttime outing, Nefer sat beside Jahoda. The \"Curatorium of Secrets' sole full-time employee's\" backpack lay open, the green glass bead within wrapped in layers of cloth to both prevent breakage and deter prying eyes.<!--\n              -->Jahoda swung her arm unconsciously and slurred:<!--\n              -->\"I'll help you... I have... a Vision...\"<!--\n              -->\"With a Vision... you can do good deeds...\"<!--\n              -->\"With a Vision... you can...\"<!--\n              -->As Nefer rose to leave, a fleeting glimmer of aquamarine light caught her eye.<!--\n              -->The owner of the Curatorium of Secrets paused in surprise, then chuckled softly.<!--\n              -->A lie repeated a thousand times had somehow willed itself into truth."
