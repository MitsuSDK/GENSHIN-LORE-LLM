To herself, Diona tries nothing less than her hardest to ruin that hateful grog.But no matter the drink, it will turn out to be an unimaginably sumptuous brew so long as it passes through her hands.This is a \"blessing\" she has received, though that blessing is a huge headache for her.For this mixologist proclaims herself to be the \"Wine Industry Slayer,\" and her final objective is the utter destruction of Mondstadt's entire wine industry."

Wow, I have never had such a wonderful drink! Can I get a refill, miss?\"\"...You want a refill!?\"To this day, Diona has struggled with her unbroken record of mixing fine drinks. Unable to accept defeat, she has yet to give up on her dream of producing something truly disgusting.However, the results are always the same, and the Cat's Tail remains a popular watering hole, with its pleased patrons singing praises unending of her skill.All poor Diona can do is puff up her cheeks, tears forming in her eyes as she grumbles:\"Just you all wait!\""

It bewitches people and makes them stupid!\"This is the source of Diona's hatred for alcohol, and the beginning of Cat's Tail's turn in fortunes.That said, Margaret, the owner of Cat's Tail, had never expected any of this to happen at all. Rather, she had a much simpler reason for hiring Diona.\"What choice did I have? She's just too cute.\""

Diona required no teacher for such skills.\"Ah, yes, and she also has a pair of eyes that can see well in the dark.\"\"As for weaknesses... She bites when piqued, so please be careful.\"Thus did Dr. Edith write of Diona in her notes for \"Studies Into Bloodlines Strange and Unfamiliar.\""

Simply exquisite. I can just feel your incomparable passion and love for wine.\"Diona's hand started to tremble as it held on to her cocktail shaker, and detecting the change at once with his sharp gaze, Elzer understood immediately.\"If a brilliant bartender as yourself were to grace the Dawn Winery with your cooperation, we shall be able to bring Monsdtadt's alcohol industry to heretofore unseen heights!\"...When Diluc questioned Elzer as to the story behind his bandaged hand later, he was uncharacteristically hesitant to say anything.\"I...

                "text": "There is a legend about a \"spring fairy\" that circulates in Diona's hometown.The fairy once saved a mother and son who had despaired beside a well, filling the barren hole with rushing waters that pooled and formed a spring. The child, deathly ill, was miraculously healed by those spring waters.Many people came to catch a glimpse of these blessed waters, and built a settlement around it, and left it not thereafter. Over time, this gave rise to the small town known as Springvale.Nowadays, few are left who believe that this is any more than a mere legend, and some even dismiss it as myth-making for tourism's sake.Only little Diona believed in the existence of the spring fairy, and on nights when her father was in a deep stuporous sleep, she would speak to the moon reflected in the spring water's surface.These were her earnest feelings, innocent and wonderful — feelings worth answering.That was what the spring fairy believed.So, Diona would make a curious friend, a companion whom she could bare her feelings to and sometimes assuage her loneliness.On the night of Diona's seventh birthday, as the moonlight reflected off the spring and upon her face, she heard the soft voice of the spring fairy.\"I will bless you, daughter of hunters, for your days ahead, and as a farewell. May your cup always run over with the sweet wine of celebration. May it always be refreshing as springs of ever-melting snow.\"From that day on, the spring fairy would never appear before Diona again, and she left those memories behind, consigning them to her childhood dreams.Till today, she has yet to realize that her troublesome constitution has anything at all to do with that dream."

He simply brought a new one back the very next day.When Diona went to Cat's Tail to try out for the role of bartender, Margaret noticed how the cocktail shaker Diona had with her looked wholly unsuited for her style.Ever skilled with handicraft, Margaret would give Diona a cocktail shaker equipped with a lovely cat's tail as an induction gift.\"Now, this suits you far better,\" Margaret said with a satisfied nod."

Instead, it can be considered a form of \"avarice.\"She wishes for her father to always be the man that she admires, and she treasures every moment that she spends with her family, unwilling to \"share\" her happiness with the wine.There was once a storm that lasted for three days, and for those three days, her father, who had been out hunting, did not return.The awful weather prevented the search parties sent by the Knights of Favonius from making much headway, and soon the dread of \"loss\" began to hang over Diona like a shroud.If she could not even stand to \"share,\" how could she bear having something utterly \"stolen\" from her?She burst out the door and into the tempest, and the waters that stood in her path were frozen by some power she did not recognize.Using her superlative tracking skills, she found her father under a broken gorge.With the help of the other hunters, she returned home with her father, and only once she realized that he would be fine did she finally smile again.\"Do you... want me to mix you a drink? It'll numb the pain a little...\"That was probably the first time she ever mixed a drink in a normal fashion.\"Ooh, it's so refreshing. It's wonderful! Hahaha—Ouch...\"Getting to drink a cocktail that his daughter had made was probably a better anesthetic by far than the alcohol itself.Still, Diona gaining power over Cryo did not help reconcile her to wine at all."
