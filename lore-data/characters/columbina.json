                "text": "To Columbina, this planet was never a kind mother. It gave her a singular, extraordinary identity when it birthed her — but that seemed to exhaust all the love it could offer. In the days that followed, her mother rejected her outstretched arms with cold silence. Columbina could only close her eyes and grope forward between one wall and another. The maze that trapped her was a circle, a spiraling tower reaching upward. Columbina softly hummed the melodies in her memory, her only connection to her \"mother.\" Barefoot, she walked through the Frostmoon Enclave and Glupov, eventually returning to the Silvermoon Hall, where her own echoes still lingered on the walls. But unlike before, she had finally found a name of her own with the help of her friends. She now had hope, as well as desires. She wanted to go home. Now, at the top of the tower, the moon that held her answers hovered just within reach. She stretched out her arms, but it was like the moon falling into water. Of Silver Skies, Cleansed Feathers, and the Returning New Moon. She walked toward death, and death answered her with rebirth. She reached the end, only to find it waiting as her beginning. The world waited in the hush that preceded creation. Within that silence, a force stirred — gravity was cast toward her, strong enough to draw a wandering moon back into its swaddling cloths. Before her, the moon's path revealed itself, a road laid out to guide the Moon Goddess home. She is no longer the moon seen through water, a distant image, endlessly shattered and restored. Instead, she will sing fate into the darkness, set the tides in motion, and bring freedom and hope to those who dwell beneath the moon. Columbina opens her eyes, as though only now she is truly born into the world."

The world of daylight was filled with too many words beyond her understanding. \"Kuutar,\" \"The Damselette,\" \"Goddess\"... She knew these words to be like mirrors, each reflecting a version of her in this unfamiliar world. But those were versions others wished to see. She did not recognize herself in those reflections, just as she did not recognize the moon hanging in the sky. At least at night, she could clearly feel the pull coming from beyond the heavens. It made no sound, yet she understood it all the same — the Frost Moon was calling her home.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Spring, summer, autumn, or winter?<!--\n              -->Winter, without question. After the restlessness of spring, the clamor of summer, and the bounty of autumn, winter's snow quietly laid a finger across the world's lips, as if to say, \"Hush. After all that bustle, isn't it time for some quiet?\"<!--\n              -->And so the world would obediently fall silent. Little animals would retreat to their homes as well. Only in winter would people truly realize how important a warm \"home\" could be.<!--\n              -->As for Columbina? She loved to find a thick, soft pile of snow, before holding her breath and diving straight in. For a goddess who wasn't particularly sensitive to cold, being wrapped head to toe in gentle white snow felt simply wonderful. As to whether her colleagues understood this behavior... Well, she concerned herself little with that.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Sunny? Rainy? Or perhaps, cloudy?<!--\n              -->A rainy morning. When Columbina woke to the soft patter of rain beyond the Silvermoon Hall, a sense of calm would settle over her — the feeling of being sheltered beneath its vaulted roof.<!--\n              -->\"Shelter.\" In the rhythm of the rain, the word resonated with renewed strength, echoing the most essential meaning that \"home\" could hold. Simply existing along the extension of that meaning was enough to fill Columbina with warmth.<!--\n              -->Still... nightfall was better when under clear skies.<!--\n              -->...<!--\n              -->Were her answers to these questions truly accurate? Might they change someday? Columbina turned these thoughts over in her mind.<!--\n              -->Probably not. But even if they did, these answers were the truest version of herself in this moment — the truest version of her on this night.<!--\n              -->Forests, lakes, and open seas... Which did she love most?<!--\n              -->She loved them all, of course."

But there was nothing in the sky, only a veil. A lie. For some reason, the first time she saw a sky full of stars, she knew it was false.

And whose voice did that singing belong to?<!--\n              -->Questions arose, one after another, from the depths of her mind. Yet the world offered not even an echo in reply.

No one appeared to desire anything from her or revere her — at least, not on the surface.<!--\n              -->The concept of \"colleagues\" was new to her, too. Within it, she sensed something both unfamiliar and deeply appealing: a sense of equality, occasionally mixed with a familiar notion of \"trade.\" She was still learning to navigate this way of life.<!--\n              -->The first to approach her was The Doctor. Columbina could hear admiration in this colleague's words — not the same as worship; at least, it was based on the premise of equality.<!--\n              -->\"If you don't mind, could you help me with a small task?\" the colleague asked politely.<!--\n              -->Help? She had expected this to be something she was obliged to give in return, but here, she actually had a choice. Or perhaps it was this very colleague who was offering her the choice.<!--\n              -->Even though The Doctor's words carried a faint echo of something ominous, like distant thunder from a far-off storm, the sense of having a choice was undeniably satisfying.<!--\n              -->At first, everything went smoothly. The Doctor's lab was filled with all sorts of strange devices, and Columbina only needed to lightly apply her power here, manipulate that there, and everything would work out.<!--\n              -->\"Not bad. You did very well.\"<!--\n              -->Columbina liked praise. It was new to her, a novel experience.<!--\n              -->But before long, compliments shifted to \"Not quite enough,\" \"You can do better,\" or \"You're capable of more...\"<!--\n              -->Suddenly, Columbina realized that what The Doctor was seeing wasn't her, but some version of what she should be, or the level her powers should reach. It reminded her of the days before she had joined the Fatui...<!--\n              -->She felt a pang of sadness. Did anyone else ever feel sad just for being themselves? She didn't know if others felt that, but she did.<!--\n              -->It wasn't that she wanted to become what others expected, but that what they saw wasn't her.

Columbina couldn't see it, but somehow remembered — this was part of a process that had to happen after eating. Different from how procedures were back with the Frostmoon Scions.<!--\n              -->The problem was, she still wasn't used to it. She knew it involved some ritual of \"trade,\" but the few times she had done it, it was always with her two recently acquainted colleagues, Arlecchino and Sandrone. Or rather, they did it for her.<!--\n              -->Columbina didn't know what to do. During that moment, she felt a kind of fear and guilt radiating from the other person, so palpable she could sense it even with her eyes closed.

You just stay out of it.\" A familiar voice appeared beside her. It was Sandrone.<!--\n              -->\"Hmph. You don't even know how to apply for reimbursement, and you dare come out to eat by yourself? Ugh. You know what, I bet you don't even know how to pay either.\" The tone was impatient, but somehow reassuring.<!--\n              -->\"The Fatui's financial rules sure are rigid... and complicated,\" she muttered, quickly filling out the slip and handing it to the trembling employee.<!--\n              -->\"From now on, put her bill on my tab. It's all the same when it comes to reimbursement anyway,\" Sandrone said irritably to the employee.<!--\n              -->\"Sorry...\" Columbina murmured to her colleague, with whom she had not been acquainted long.

You don't blame me?\" Columbina asked.<!--\n              -->\"Huh? Why? Isn't this just who you are?\" came the exasperated reply. \"Seriously, though, I don't get how someone like you even survives in this world...\"<!--\n              -->No \"You should be like this,\" no \"You could do better\"... only \"This is who you are.\"<!--\n              -->Though Sandrone's tone was always impatient, there was a recognition in it — a silent acknowledgment that this was \"who she really was.\" Columbina felt joy at being seen in this way.<!--\n              -->\"...What are you smirking at?\" Sandrone asked.<!--\n              -->Columbina shook her head.<!--\n              -->\"Nothing. Let's go eat together next time, Sandrone,\" she said. \"I like seeing you handle the 'reimbursements' for me.\"<!--\n              -->\"...What?\" It seemed her dear colleague would need some time to get used to how \"she really was\" all the same."

Sometimes it would be a tree hollow, at others a bird's nest. She would stand nearby, listening to the steady rhythm of their breaths while lifting her eyes to the moon above. It was as if, by doing so, she could imagine what nighttime on the moon might be like — quiet and peaceful. She hoped it was.<!--\n              -->On nights like these, she pieced together dreams of what a \"home\" might be.<!--\n              -->When she once again returned to Hiisi Island, she met a certain contemporary Moonchanter.

Please continue, Columbina Hyposelenia.\"<!--\n              -->After meeting that Moonchanter, Columbina occasionally made surreptitious visits to her home as well. She discovered, however, that the moon's tides seemed to bring some restless pain to said Moonchanter.

Sometimes, she would find herself humming familiar melodies, instinctively — the lullaby that had once comforted her before her birth.<!--\n              -->\"A lullaby from before your birth?\" This time it was Aria, goddess of the Eternal Moon, who spoke up.<!--\n              -->Columbina explained the melodies she had heard before being born.<!--\n              -->The three goddesses shook their heads.

Everyone was nice to me. We even played water-ball games together.\"<!--\n              -->\"Unimaginable. It seems our era was far too conservative,\" the goddess of the Eternal Moon said, clearly astonished.<!--\n              -->\"We even stuck little stickers on each other's faces.\"<!--\n              -->A few soft gasps of surprise came from the three goddesses.<!--\n              -->\"We also exchanged food, tasting the candy in each other's hands.\"<!--\n              -->The goddesses fell silent.

So whenever I had the chance, I would follow behind her, trying to figure out the pattern of its movement. But one day, she suddenly turned around and demanded to know why I kept following her. After I told her the reason, she said, \"If you're that curious, why don't I put one on your back, and you can see for yourself?\" So I lived with a key on my back for a few days, and it was quite the challenge. Sandrone doesn't have it easy, so I've looked out for her even more since then."
