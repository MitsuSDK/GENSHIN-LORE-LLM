At a glance, she resembles an adorably dressed teenage girl with two tails swaying behind her. Though she treats each of her customers with kindness and generosity, secretly she sometimes takes to running quietly across rooftops to ensure none of her deliveries arrive late...\nThough her obvious nature as a youkai drew more than few comments at first, as Kirara introduced herself with honesty and clarity time and time again while conducting her tasks with dutifulness and effectiveness, people not only dropped all lingering misgivings but even grew grateful for her presence. \"Safe and punctual,\" \"service assured,\" \"vivacious and adorable\"... These three phrases are words most commonly used to describe Kirara on the feedback board. Word is that if you give her a five-star rating or offer her some snacks, you might even see Kirara's face brighten with gratitude as her tails whirl with building joy.\nTo Kirara, her job is as precious as any jewel. She treasures everything about human society and is always overjoyed to behold the smiling faces of her customers. Thus, she gives her all to offer the best service she can for everyone she caters to. After all, if she finds herself fired by the company, all she can do is return being a youkai in the mountains.\nThankfully, her boss at Komaniya Express had never even considered the idea of releasing her. Contrarily, they privately asked Kirara if she wanted higher pay and to transition into comparatively less effortful secretarial work, but Kirara rejected their offer with haste. She didn't have the heart to tell her boss that, to her, every time she leaves to make a delivery, it feels like she's getting to enjoy an outing at the public's expense!"

After a stretch, a yawn, and a single \"meow\" as though to bellyache about her circumstances, she would begin to hunt for breakfast. The menu often included finches that had let down their guard, or overly curious young fish too near the shore.<!--\n              -->Whenever she encountered adventurers out in the wilderness, she would lie down at a safe distance and watch intently as they fished out all kinds of marvelous instruments from their packs. Fwoosh! Suddenly there was a fire roaring. Bong! A strange cauldron was set over the fire. And then, with a bubbling sound, an intoxicating scent would occasionally waft over on the breeze...<!--\n              -->Observing this process with wide eyes, to her it was as if she had witnessed magic. Thus a yearning for human society began to flutter about in her chest, as though a butterfly had flown into her heart.<!--\n              -->During a frigid winter night with the biting winds howling, Kirara, still a small kitten, was frozen to the point of being unable to feel her tail.<!--\n              -->\"Gotta find a warm place to hide. Even a hollow in a tree will do...\" She thought to herself. But when she was able to look up, she saw a cluster of warm lights flickering not too far away...<!--\n              -->This was the first time Kirara entered a human home, and while she was curious about everything around her, she was also frightened. The owner of the house seemed not to notice the kitten that had found its way into her home, but Kirara paid little notice. She found a small square box near the entryway into which she snugly fit, and into it did she sit, falling asleep almost immediately.<!--\n              -->\"I'll just rest the night, just one night...\" were her last thoughts before dreams took her...<!--\n              -->Yet when she awoke, she found a warm fire crackled away next to her, and beside it was a fragrant bowl of nekomanma. Directly across from her was an old lady in the middle of knitting a woolen sweater. The old lady seemed to be trying to say something, as though encouraging her to eat. With her tail down and guard raised, she cautiously took a bite of that aromatic nekomanma in front of her that she was so curious about...<!--\n              -->It was the most delicious thing she had ever eaten, to the point she began to doubt whether or not she was still dreaming!<!--\n              -->And so, she stayed in that cozy little home for one winter after another, and heard story after story from that kind old woman...<!--\n              -->On occasion, when Kirara thinks back to that first night, she'll cock her head and ask herself:<!--\n              -->\"Strange... what was I thinking about before I fell asleep again...?\""

She eagerly explored every nook and cranny in the city, and not even the roof of the Almighty Shogun's Tenshukaku was immune from her curiosity. This is the reason that the Tenryou Commission is one of the addresses she is most familiar with.<!--\n              -->Though the Tenryou Commission taught her rules like \"don't climb on other people's roofs\" and \"don't eat the ornamental koi\", then she learned \"how to be a good youkai in human society\" from none other than the Lady Kitsune of the Grand Narukami Shrine. Kirara has caught the eye of \"the greatest and coolest youkai,\" as she calls her, and Yae Miko, for her part, has been willing to impart all her experience upon her lively and interesting junior. Upon learning that Kirara felt the streets and alleys of Inazuma City were priceless treasures, Miko recommended that she seek employment at Komaniya Express.<!--\n              -->\"If you want to blend into human society, then you must work like an ordinary human.

I was happy to help at first, but then I'd hear the cats say things like \"I just want to see the outside world!\" or \"I get so bored when I'm at home,\" I felt bad for them. So I lied, telling him that I hadn't seen any cat at all. But it seemed like he could see right through me..."

Are they ever an inconvenience? How does she deal with shedding feathers? Mm... Speaking of the feathers, I think lining my box with them would be super comfy."

There are so many little joys in the world that deserve to be savored, and it'd be such a great loss if I didn't relish every one of them.
