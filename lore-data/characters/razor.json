He has rarely been sighted, as he keeps his distance from other humans.\nSome say he is an orphan raised by wolves. Others say he is a wolf spirit in human form...\nAs the rumours grow, so does the mystery surrounding this Wolf Boy.\nAll the while, Razor the Wolf Boy stands today on a mountaintop, basking in the warm sunlight, with his family — his \"Lupical\" — of wolves by his side."

The one thing he can't bring to mind is the faces of his parents.What kind of people were they? No matter how hard he tries, he cannot remember.His memory starts after his life with the wolves had already begun. The wolves took him in as part of their \"Lupical\" — a word he was taught by someone else, which means family."

Cool off in the lake when you're hot, and go find some juicy berries when you're thirsty.Razor looks at his body and then at the bodies of his kin.He knows he is different from them.But there's nothing wrong with that, as far as Razor is concerned."

Why don't you come back down to Mondstadt with me?\"The man offered his hand to Razor as he spoke.But neither Razor nor the wolves understood the gesture. Feeling protective, the wolves placed themselves between Razor and the man to keep him away.Razor ducked down beneath the wolves' furry tails. He looked at his body, and then peered out through the gaps in the wolf fur to get a look at the man's.Razor knew he wasn't the most intelligent of beings, and was at a loss to answer the question that has been in his mind ever since that day.\"Am I a human, or a wolf?\""

Unwieldy though this steel claw may be, thought Razor, it was at least sharp enough to cut through tree branches.\"Now you can protect your friends.\"\"Fr-ren-dzz...\"Razor imitated the sounds the man made, without understanding what they meant.Similarly, he did not understand why the names of things were all that important in the first place.

He just couldn't figure it out.Until one day, Razor met a bright-red, 'burny' girl.They stood in the wind together, got soaked in the rain together — she even rolled around in Wolfhook bushes with him.Her name was Klee. When Razor played with her, it was like being a wolf pup again.\"Friends... is... Lupical.\"Razor may not understand the complexity of human relationships, but he has an honest, primal loyalty to him.\"So... protect friends... Lupical... with life.\"The wolf pack howls in the distance, summoning him home.Razor still does not know if he is a human or a wolf.But he is happy either way."

He was ready to avenge.He threw off his shackles and raised his weapon.The Abyss Mage was overwhelmed and defeated by a wild, unfettered frenzy of Electro energy, but this time it was too late to save Razor's wolven companions....Though he had obtained a Vision, Razor was still unable to manipulate Electro energy with finesse. One day many moons later, when he met the Witch of Purple Rose, Lisa, he began to study human knowledge.\"Friends, hurt... Never again! I will... protect them.\"With each day, Razor grew more skilled in the use of his Vision. He made a silent promise to himself: \"I will become stronger. I will become the strongest of them all.\"Because the day may come when his Lupical faces another threat, and this time, he will protect them."
