                "text": "\"A chaotic place, lashed by howling, frigid winds.\" For many, this is their first impression of Nod-Krai. But once you familiarize yourself with its rules and patiently explore the land, you'll come to know that it is full of marvelous, wonderful things as well. As you shop, you may meet a robot girl making purchases like anyone else while the clanking of curiously-shaped foundries echoes through the markets. If you're lucky, you may also catch a glimpse of robots speeding by... Ask around, and you'll learn that these are all Aino's creations.\nIf this piques your curiosity, and you wish to meet this genius inventor, it's no tall order. Just walk out of Nasha Town and head to the outskirts, where a giant metal building awaits. Before even stepping inside, you'll be greeted by a unique aroma — a blend of machine oil, metal, and krumkakes, the smell of home for Aino, who stays here with Ineffa, her all-purpose household robot. Aino lives life by a simple creed: Invent interesting mechanical wonders for fun, and when not tinkering away, enjoy the best snack in the world — Ineffa's freshly-baked krumkakes.\nHowever, not all are lucky enough to meet this genius mechanic. Any who do not appreciate her creations will see the Craftshop's door slam shut in their face. So, before flooding her with endless new requests, maybe shower Aino's designs with some well-deserved praise first. Otherwise... Well, wouldn't it be a shame if disgusting krumkakes started popping out of your next mechanical device for whatever reason?"

All year round, the cold wind howls and lashes the lands, as though attempting to wring even the last dregs of warmth from every corner.<!--\n              -->Yet in this seemingly forgotten corner of the world, the marketplace is chock-a-block with an astonishing array of marvelous machines. From guns that shoot flowers to floor sweepers that act as affectionate as puppies... You never know how a contraption might act until the very moment it springs to life. These inventions have brought comfort and laughter to this desolate land, and their creator is none other than Aino, the owner of the Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop.<!--\n              -->Aino has spent years secluded in this unique workshop with not a single plushie (something children should love) in sight. Instead, she surrounds herself with sheets upon sheets of cold metal and mechanical parts piled precariously high. But this doesn't stop Aino from seeing it as the bestest and warmest home in the world. Here, she enjoys the companionship of numerous family members — assembled by her from screws and steel.<!--\n              -->Aino, who calls herself their \"parent,\" takes on the responsibility of caring for her little mechanical family every day. In the morning, they need to \"wake up\" by powering on, they have to \"charge\" themselves up with lunch at noon, then \"sleep\" in the night by powering down, right on schedule. Whatever spare time they have, they spend on diligently \"executing tasks.\"<!--\n              -->Besides the creations she makes as a hobby, this genius mechanic also takes on various mechanical commissions. From the massive Boom and Blast Kuuvahki Energy Cannon that defends everyone from the Wild Hunt's invasions, to tiny precision parts in mechanical arms for aged adventurers... As long as you sincerely praise this genius mechanic's brilliant ideas and offer her delicious desserts, she'll create masterpieces beyond your wildest imagination.<!--\n              -->However, her inventions occasionally come with bizarre features not included in the original commission's requirements. In that sense, placing an order with Aino is like buying a box of chocolates... except that the box has a chance to fire a scary doll at you when you open it — so you'd best pray it doesn't!"

Back then, Aino spoke in a voice as faint as a mosquito's buzz, barely audible in any room she was in. She was so unassuming that it seemed almost impossible to reconcile that memory of her with the genius mechanic she is today.<!--\n              -->Katya could no longer remember if she had ever asked Aino herself about the details of how she showed up at the Speranza. In this bitter frontier, there were only two reasons why a child would be alone — unavoidable separation or deliberate abandonment. Neither was particularly rare.<!--\n              -->The rain in Nod-Krai is bone-chillingly cold, its arrival both sudden and merciless. Little Aino, who could barely reach the table's edge even on tiptoes, could only silently accept the grueling hand that fate had dealt her.<!--\n              -->Katya remembered pulling the timid girl, who had been peering through the doorway, into the house and handing her a bowl of warm, sweet soup. But as soon as the girl's fingertips touched the rim of the bowl, she quickly recoiled — her hands were swollen and purple from the cold, with cracks in her skin more striking than the scarlet broth. However brief her contact with the bowl, it must have stung her with pain.<!--\n              -->Katya wrapped her tiny, injured hands in clean old cloth, and only then did the girl dare to clutch the bowl. With a few quick slurps, she gulped down the soup, finishing her meal in the blink of an eye.<!--\n              -->From that day on, little Aino stayed at the Speranza and became a member of the Conch Gang."

The kind-hearted Katya provides them with shelter and jobs as shop assistants, while giving these children plenty of freedom during their breaks.<!--\n              -->At the age when they were most energetic and adventurous, the other children roamed the tundra forests in packs like Chic Badger cubs, but little Aino was the only one who preferred to be alone.<!--\n              -->This wasn't due to a lack of childlike curiosity. On the contrary, her curiosity was so vast that only an entire world could contain it — a world made with precise, logical lines, craftsmanship, mechanisms, and curios. Any metal component was enough to make Aino stop in her tracks, and the noise of clinking and clanking from the \"Rossum Workshop\" workshop was the song she came to be most familiar with.<!--\n              -->This is how she met her lifelong best friend — Lyulka, the daughter of the owner of the \"Nuts and Bolts.\" When Lyulka discovered that this girl, who visited their shop almost daily, had the same sparkle in her eyes as herself, she excitedly took her by the hand, suddenly eager to share her mechanical contraptions and half-finished prototypes.<!--\n              -->One day, after they became close, Aino suddenly pointed at a machine in the store, and said, \"Adjusting this part a little should increase the kuuvahki consumption efficiency by 2.8%. I've been running simulations in my head for a while, and I think it's got a good chance of working... So, wanna try?\"<!--\n              -->Lyulka was stunned. That was exactly the bottleneck she'd been struggling with for days. Although she felt slightly hesitant that an untrained child had pointed out the issue so easily, she still nodded in agreement.<!--\n              -->When the modification was complete, the test data was precise, showing an improvement of exactly 2.8%. As she stared at the truth laid out by the data, Lyulka's skepticism dissolved into amazement.<!--\n              -->\"Aino's never studied a day of mechanical theory in her life, and yet she identified and resolved a critical issue. Now, if she DOES study, she might be able to work miracles...\""

A Snezhnayan mechanic known as \"Papa Wrench\" happened to visit Nasha Town, and while dining at the Speranza, he was drawn to the group of child workers. Papa Wrench, being a man full of compassion, decided to stay for a while to regale the children with Snezhnayan fairy tales.<!--\n              -->But he quickly and keenly noticed that one of the children was not quite like the others — while they were immersed in his stories, Aino's gaze was firmly fixed on the tools he carried.<!--\n              -->This discovery filled Papa Wrench's heart with joy, and with Katya's approval, he set up a small class during the restaurant's downtime to teach mechanical know-how to children who were interested.<!--\n              -->When Lyulka heard of this class, she excitedly joined the children. However, after just a few days, Lyulka realized that the things Aino asked Papa Wrench were starting to become as incomprehensible as some arcane tome.<!--\n              -->Before, Aino had been like a tranquil stream, silently meandering forward... But now it seemed that she had finally found a vast, boundless ocean to call her own.<!--\n              -->Utterly in her element, a mysterious change overcame Aino, as though some fae of legend had touched her with a blessed hand, bestowing upon her secret gifts. Aino's fingers danced between various parts, an intricate machine seemingly flying into being at her expert touch. It was hard to imagine her dexterous digits had ever been blistered with frostbite.<!--\n              -->And as her hands grew more lively, so too did the conversations she made. Aino began to speak more and more, her little head seemingly filled with endless novel ideas waiting to be shared with the world. Most adults who heard her would find the child peculiar and dismiss her ideas with a gentle smile, but Papa Wrench believed that she might one day truly turn all of her imaginative concepts into reality.<!--\n              -->And when Papa Wrench's knowledge collided with Aino's wild ideas, the result was an explosion of ingenuity that brightened the lives of those around them...<!--\n              -->The Conch Gang's broken alarm clocks were fixed, but suddenly grew wings and would fly around their rooms in the mornings, ringing all the while. Only catching them would put an end to the cacophony, and from then on, there were no more sleepyheads among the children.<!--\n              -->The broken trash can in the back kitchen was also patched up with tin plates. When fed with garbage, it would chew up everything contentedly, then let loose a playful burp of satisfaction. At first, everyone suspected it was a prank, but after discovering that the sounds were actually coming from the trash can itself, taking out the garbage became the children's most popular chore."

Reluctant to leave, he placed a screw in Aino's palm and told the girl two important things: To never underestimate her talents, nor to ever put down her tools. This wasn't Aino's first farewell. The cold wind seemed to leave her throat sandpaper-dry, and besides a cursory \"thank you,\" \"goodbye,\" and \"take care,\" Aino didn't know what else she could say. In this turbulent land, every farewell could very well be their last. This unspoken rule was understood — and keenly felt — all over Nod-Krai.<!--\n              -->After bidding farewell to her teacher, Aino sat alone behind closed doors, repeatedly running her fingertips over the grooves of the screw. After her tears had dried, she threaded the screw into her hair. From then on, this screw served both as an iron hairpin and a guiding light, keeping up the bangs that had once obscured her vision. Now, the path before her was clearer than ever.<!--\n              -->After this farewell, the wheel of fate began to spin once more.<!--\n              -->The members of the Conch Gang had always come and gone freely. After bidding farewell to several familiar friends in the howling cold winds, Aino bade farewell to the Gang as well. Lyulka had reached out to her, asking if she would like to move in with her, and perhaps even set up a workshop together. After much deliberation, Aino shook her head. While conducting stable research with a friend would be nice, she wanted to journey farther, see more, and create fascinating machines that none had ever made before.<!--\n              -->Aino had heard from some adventure-loving children that if one were to leave Nasha Town and head west, there was a place piled high with abandoned metal scrap — perfect for young explorers to use as a secret base. However, the mead-drunk, grizzled adventurers of the town saw it differently. They claimed it was a mechanical boneyard that had fallen into ruin during Nod-Krai's golden years, its name long eroded by the river of time.<!--\n              -->\"Discarded metal scrap, a mechanical boneyard... Well, time for me to breathe some new life into it...!\"<!--\n              -->Though she had never been there, Aino was filled with longing for that storied location.

Followed by an automated toolbox with wheels, and guided by members of the Conch Gang, she arrived at a massive structure on the outskirts of town.

From now on, I'm calling it the Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop. Here, I'll invent a machine that can make the most delicious krumkakes!\" With one hand on her hip, Aino made her declaration.

Just like any good parent, Aino carefully taught her \"child\" how to make purchases... even though said \"child\" was several heads taller than her \"parent.\"<!--\n              -->\"Be good and hold my hand, Ineffa! It would be really bad if you ran off and got lost.\"<!--\n              -->\"Now let's learn about shopping! First, come here, say hello to Aunty Katya, then ask for two Midsommar Tortes.

Oh, wait, I almost forgot. Aunty Katya, could you take the change and gimme some sugar for it? I'm gonna have Ineffa make me some of the BEST krumkakes in the whole world!\"<!--\n              -->But despite all the change, Aino's sweet tooth had stayed constant. Katya couldn't help but smile as she placed several packets of sugar into the robot girl's hands — far more than what would have been commensurate with the Mora.<!--\n              -->\"Calculating price difference... The amount of Mora paid is insufficient. I must compensate...\" Before the robot girl could finish, Aino interrupted her.<!--\n              -->\"That there is Aunty Katya's love! Just take it, Ineffa. She'll be sad if we try to pay for it. So thanks, Aunty Katya!\"<!--\n              -->\"Love?\"<!--\n              -->\"Yeah!

She could complete most simple mechanical constructions with her eyes closed, and it was rare to see her this focused.<!--\n              -->But today, her surroundings were pitch black, with only Aino's workbench blazing bright as day. Her long sleeves had been hastily rolled up, and her temples were covered in sweat, stained with oil, and brushed by dust from who-knows-where, but the only thing Aino could focus on — and frown at — was the problem she faced. On the workshop's floor, open bags of snacks lay scattered, but even the wafting, saccharine scents could not tempt Aino from her task.<!--\n              -->On the workbench lay a robot girl.

So, without even a glance, she tossed it under her workbench and continued focusing on her creation.<!--\n              -->With a soft click, the final piece fit precisely into the last groove. There was a clatter as Aino's tools fell to the ground, followed by a dull thud — having maintained intense focus for so long, Aino had finally reached her limit.

The next time Ineffa's here, let's both give her a big hug at the same time!"

I'll get Ineffa to make Krumkake for you... No, wait — I'll make them myself! And, and I can make Midsommar Torte too. It's really good, have you tried it? ...Hmm? Why are you running away?

I'm not a controlling parent, so I don't tell Ineffa who she can and can't make friends with. Some friends just argue more than others — somehow, fighting it out brings them closer together. Oh, I almost forgot to mention, you know her robotic arm? It's pretty, right? I was the one who built that, although it's my student who handles the maintenance and repairs these days."

As Ineffa put it, the amount I'd earn in one day of working for Dori wouldn't even cover the cost of two freshly baked Fruit Tandem Turnovers. Genius only works on a full stomach, y'know! *sigh* If only she was open to letting me dismantle those strange and exotic machines she owns. Maybe then we could come to an arrangement..."

When I was a bit older, and I'd learned how to build robots, I wanted to give her one as a gift... but she never accepted any of them. She said it was the thought that counts, and that was enough for her — but I think it was because none of them were her style. So, I'm gonna keep making robots until she finds one she likes. I know I'll get there eventually!"

Then one day, Ineffa told me that she saw me as family, and that I could trust her... I burst out crying when she said that, because I know that robots don't tell lies..."
