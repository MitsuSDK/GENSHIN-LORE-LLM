When flowers withered, they were like falling tears.

Sorrow washed over her, but it soon turned to unease.<!--\n              -->Indeed, her mission from the heavens did not include sorrow.

I don't believe they ever did catch up with that horse."

Here in the present, people seem accustomed to calling me the White Horse Adeptus, and that is fine by me. Do I ever see Zhongli around, you ask? Why yes, I occasionally see him walking the streets with Director Hu or enjoying a cup of tea on his own. I must say, his life as a consultant seems far more pleasant and relaxed than his life as Rex Lapis."

I had heard that she had a reputation for being a bold and unstoppable commander, and I must say she certainly lives up to it."

When one of them did not feel like being on duty, she would beg another to take her place, then make it up to her later with gifts of makeup and jewelry. However, so liberal were they with this ad-hoc shift-swapping business that it sometimes led to chaos. For instance, there once was a year when all three moons aligned, but this only happened because they all got the timing mixed up. And so, there came a day on which only one moon should have been on duty, but all three appeared in the sky at once. They hurried to line up in a row, two moons trying their best to hide behind the one who was supposed to be on duty... but alas, they still gave the poor people down below a most terrible fright. They burned incense for several days straight... After that incident, the sisters asked me to try to convey to the people of the world that the sight of three moons together in the sky was not an omen of impending disaster, nor a sign that regime change was nigh. Naturally, I put the question back to them, inquiring what such a phenomenon should represent to humanity. They hemmed and hawed for a while before finally saying: \"It means... It means a festival is coming, and... everyone should eat Fullmoon Cakes, and... stuff...\""

I indeed had some influence over the weather, but the bountiful harvests were entirely due to the hard work of the nation's people. How did I guide Lang-Gan? Not with any grandeur or majesty, that's for sure. Save for a few interventions to divine the future, ward off evil, and prevent disasters, I spent the majority of my time as a teacher. I taught children how to read and write, do arithmetic, and play music. In my spare time, I compiled and edited texts on matters of etiquette, music, and the like."

Consider those from Liyue who climb the mountains in search of the adepti, motivated only by selfish gain. Even if they are lucky enough to obtain adeptal treasures, those treasures will ultimately be their undoing if their intentions are impure. Now, of course, while cultivating virtue in one's heart, one must also sharpen the blade in one's hand. As the saying goes, one ought to hope for the best but prepare for the worst."

I'm sure the ancient sages would be delighted to know that someone is still curating the historical records of Lang-Gan all these centuries later....You don't think this is very adeptus-like of me? Well, so be it. What the Liyue Harbor of today needs is not the extraordinary might of a handful of adepti, but the combined strength of its mortal populace united. I'm sure the other adepti are quite cognizant of this fact too. In any case, my role is to be a guide, and I continue to fulfill that by being an educator."
