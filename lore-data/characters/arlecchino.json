If some uninformed passerby were to stumble in at this precise moment, they would surely mistake the scene before them for that of an ordinary, happy family.\nBut just as Arlecchino raised her steaming cup to take a sip of scalding-hot black tea, the clock began to chime — and within an instant, the laughter and cheer that filled the room were banished. The flames flickered so that for a moment the light faltered, the faces of all present cast in somber expression.\nPlacing her cup back down, Arlecchino stood up, and in a calm, measured tone, called out several names:\n\"Chapleau, you're with Lyney. Retrieve the required intelligence. Foltz, you and Filliol are on guard duty. Stay back and tend to the Hearth...\"\n\"Yes, 'Father.'\"\nWithout a redundant syllable, nor a hint of hesitation, they answered as one.\nNot long after, the fire had dwindled and the house fallen utterly silent, with nothing to be seen but a single shaft of infiltrating moonlight, peeking through a gap in the curtains upon a cup of gradually cooling tea."

She was a Harbinger, famed and experienced, and nearly everything I knew about fighting was taught by her hand.However, it appears you need only desire something with sufficient intensity, and the gods will answer. In the end, I gained a Vision, and after making certain sacrifices, I mastered this power. Surpassing one's teacher often requires the pursuit of the unexpected."

Still, I'm well aware that, even with these efforts, the House is far from that ideal. As for what a real home truly looks like, I suppose that question is best put to the side for now... Perhaps one day, Lyney will be able to give me a new answer."

I imagine she quite enjoyed being surrounded by children, perhaps due to the persistent loneliness that plagued her... I found her sacrifice to be a great shame.

It was only after I became a Harbinger that I finally learned the truth from The Jester. He expressed surprise that the Crimson Moon bloodline had not gone extinct, and that, in a strange twist of fate, the House of the Hearth had ended up in the hands of an orphan of that lineage once again.I cannot say what the future holds.
