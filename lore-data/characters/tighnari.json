Don't worry. I'm sure the people's attention will shift to something else soon.\"<!--\n              -->Pragmatic as these words were, they quickly found traction with the Forest Rangers.

Whatever do you suppose he meant by 'a more tasteful reputation'?\"&nbsp;...It's a good question. I'd like to know, too."

Collei got really upset, because she thought there was nothing for her to do anymore...People say Sethos is good at keeping himself amused — he certainly seems pretty cheerful. But he takes his work very seriously. Hmm, although I don't know how accurate \"work\" is — I think he sees his role at the Temple of Silence as more of a kind of duty. Anyway, if you ever find yourself needing assistance in the desert, I'm sure he'd be a good person to go to."
