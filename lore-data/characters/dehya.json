They consist of many mercenaries and bands of warriors-for-hire who carry out assignments independently.\nOne such brigade is the \"Blazing Beasts,\" whose most renowned member is Dehya, also known as the \"Flame-Mane.\"\nA highly regarded warrior among the mercenary circles, Dehya is brave without being impulsive, and strong without being arrogant. Life in the harsh desert environment has allowed Dehya to accumulate much combat wisdom through various battles, and she is by no means your typical insolent and ignorant martial artist.\nAs long as the pay is good and the commission reasonable, Dehya is more than willing to take up her sword to defend those who hire her.\nHowever, there is one thing these employers should be aware of. That is, the agreement they establish with Dehya is only temporary and purely transactional. The reins to tame this lioness is never, and will never be in their hands.\nAlthough mercenaries sell their strength to make a living, their dignity and lives belong only to themselves.\nThe desert lioness is no one's slave, and her sword only follows her heart."

Even so, the other mercenaries have a great many reasons to hold her in high regard.<!--\n              -->Firstly, though she is not the strongest in her profession, she has force enough all the same.<!--\n              -->Should one doubt this, they merely need to test the weight of her blade. To make such a greatsword dance and flow without sufficient strength would be impossible otherwise.<!--\n              -->Secondly, she has tremendous combat instincts. It is known that the greatsword, Dehya's weapon of choice, demands a trade-off between force and speed. Should such a weapon fail to achieve a decisive first strike against a sufficiently mobile foe, it will prove more burden than a boon for the wielder. In moments like these, Dehya uses her superior insight and technique to overcome the opposition.<!--\n              -->Sometimes, she will cast her weapon aside, eschewing the edge of a sword for the weight behind her fists. She will even hurl her weapon at foes without warning to buy a fleeting opportunity. How any such moment plays out all depends on the actual conditions presented by each battle.<!--\n              -->Aside being good in a fight, she also knows plenty about surviving in the desert.<!--\n              -->The commissions that the Eremites most often take will have them serving as bodyguards against raiders without outside support, herding away dangerous creatures, and assisting their clients in avoiding dreaded weather conditions.<!--\n              -->Sometimes, they even find assignments that have them acting as guides, helping caravans, adventurers, and researchers reach their desired destinations.<!--\n              -->Dehya knows how to deal with startled scorpion swarms, how to circle around vultures to avoid getting entangled with those nimble annoyances, and how to negotiate and minimize danger when faced with robbers.<!--\n              -->Clients like it when matters are handled thoroughly and practically. To earn true praise from their employers, mercenaries must offer more than just brute capacity for violence.<!--\n              -->Indeed, the ability to overcome one hundred or even a thousand foes has its limits, for when sandstorms scour the earth and sky, even the mightiest warrior will be buried beneath its shroud.<!--\n              -->A wise mercenary knows when to retreat, and how to preserve themselves even while meeting their objectives, for doing so exemplifies the true heights of strategy."

They chittered and clamored, trying to give Dehya a vicious moniker capable of instilling debilitating terror in potential clients, usually beginning with \"bloody\" or \"terror.\"<!--\n              -->Dehya was not such an amateur as to think that a title alone might encapsulate the entirety of what others felt about her. But still, as if everyone wanted to kill some time on this matter, she didn't mind.<!--\n              -->As she listened to bad suggestion after terrible suggestion, she couldn't help but guffaw with laughter. The atmosphere reminded her of moments from her childhood when her father gathered his compatriots to put on plays for her, detailing chivalrous heroes defending the helpless or messy brawls between siblings to amuse everyone. There was no specific point to it, except to bring some cheer while surviving in the vast emptiness under the desert's midnight sky.<!--\n              -->And just as the chatting was starting to put her in a good mood, that old ne'er-do-well's shadow slid back into her mind. Though admittedly disgruntled, Dehya did her best to keep the curl of her lips imperceptible.<!--\n              -->That night, Dehya rejected several laughable names, such as the \"Sovereign of the Sands\" and \"The Crimson Edge.\" She thought it was time to let the farce come to a close. It was just a name after all, and true mercenaries did not let such things affect their business much.<!--\n              -->Just then, an aged mercenary interrupted the discussion. At first, he snorted disdainfully at the stupidity of those around him. Then, he asked a question: \"The Legend of the Lion. This story ring a bell for anyone?\"<!--\n              -->This tale was, naturally, one Dehya was familiar with. During her childhood, her father had told her lots of old stories — far too many, really. She had wanted to forget everything that had to do with him, but memories are not so easily consigned to oblivion.<!--\n              -->While she was lost in the twists and turns of her past, her companions decided upon a title for her that actually sounded quite alright: \"Flame-Mane.\"<!--\n              -->And though she loathed the man The Legend of the Lion reminded her of, she found herself halted just before she could reject the name. Was it not all too petty to refuse such goodwill on that account?<!--\n              -->Must she avoid all the things related to her father, just because she wanted to forget him? Of course not. Besides, the story had brought a genuine feeling of warmth and comfort to Dehya, allowing her to face the world with open eyes, experience all it had to offer — and those experiences had not been falsehoods.<!--\n              -->So why not take up the title of \"Flame-Mane?\" She could have done far worse."

When she finds the opportunity, should her environment allow it, she always seizes the chance to take a shower and part her person from the stench of sweat.

Can you beat the lion?\" Little Dehya asked Kusayla.<!--\n              -->\"Hard to say, but I know quite a few tricks, so I think should be able to give that beast the business.\" Caution lit Kusayla's expression, betraying no hint of boasting.<!--\n              -->\"If the lion charges me, I'll... dip down beneath it, angle myself under its body, and then... Open its stomach with my blade. That should be enough to do it in.\"<!--\n              -->Unsatisfied with mere words, Kusayla called upon another of their band to pretend to be a lion, planning to give a personal performance for a triumph most hypothetical.

I dunno how many times she's turned me down now. Ugh, if I really can't persuade her, I guess I'll just have to watch the village for her sometime, and get one of my Eremite girls to take her shopping..."
