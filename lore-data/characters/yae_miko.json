Well, I did ask him to write on this topic, yes, but isn't this the hot genre of the day?\"Faced with the editor's doubtful gaze, Miko gave her opinion forthrightly: that a book that should have been interesting yet was shackled at every turn by the topic was, simply put, \"not free enough.\"Things like \"top sellers,\" \"genre fiction,\" these were naught but fads that would come and go every decade.Getting with the times was a shortcut, yes, but if a work had the quality that could surmount this tide, why go with the flow nonetheless?\"Pass this message to this new author of ours: tell him that there's no need to bother about genre. He just needs to write his story and write it well.\"Upon hearing this, the author stopped writing for a time, as if suddenly having an epiphany. Several months later, a new manuscript was sent to Miko and her editors.The latter were stunned, and even Yae Miko, who cared little about taboos, furrowed her brows slightly — a rare sight indeed.\"Um... What do we do? This isn't good...\"\"Exactly! I mean, there's 'not being concerned about genre, and then there's something like 'Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden'... This is just too much!\"\"Hmm? Genre? No, no, there's no problem with that — it's his pen name I'm worried about. It's too normal for a book like this.\"\"Huh, so that was what you were concerned about... No, uh, never mind. As long as you're happy, Lady Yae.\"Not long after, the author of this book would take to the literary stage with the Yae Miko-approved (and overly long) pen name \"Kadenokouji Kenzaburou.\"As to how the editor-in-chief got the idea to start a \"Reborn as Guuji Yae\" writing submission event, that would be a tale for another day."

As the years fly by, boredom becomes the greatest foe.And if even she were, archon-forbid, one day to accept sitting quietly still, obstinate as deadwood, would the world now sorely lack for another clever person adept at discovering fun and grasping opportunity?As such, looking for fun things to do in every nook and cranny can only be the most reasonable and necessary course.And if she were to, say, utilize her authority as Guuji in making fun things happen — why, some things are unavoidable, are they not?On the day of the festival, Guuji Yae would nod in satisfaction as she received a delivery of fireworks from the Yashiro Commission — of Naganohara construction and specially-made to boot.That night's ceremony was, of course, performed with perfect respect to all etiquette and rites.The sight of the \"Lady Guuji\" kneeling gracefully the whole night through would be the object of awe for all the other shrine maidens.In the meantime, she would sit beneath the meteor shower of light adorning the skies, watching the festival-goers as they came and went.And the din of the fireworks covered the mumbling that came between teeth chewing on a candy apple.\"You know, when you asked me to become Guuji, you never mentioned that I'd only ever be able to sneak outside to watch the festivities from then on.\""

But no one minded, asking only that the tale be interesting. As time passed, this became known as \"hyakumonogatari daikai,\" or \"the great meeting of a hundred tales.\"It was no uncommon sight to see Urakusai raise his cup and speak, holding all the other youkai spellbound with his story, drawing even smiles from Kitsune Saiguu, the organizer of the event.Instead it was Miko, who was then in the form of a young kitsune, who would perch on Kitsune Saiguu's shoulder and relentless peck at any loopholes in Urakusai's story.Urakusai, being a cool-headed and brilliant gentleman, would explain as he twirled his beard.But Miko could always find something new to nitpick, and so they would go, back and forth, until Lady Saiguu would smile and call both parties to a halt: the audience wanted to hear the next part, after all.After another three rounds of drink and several more rounds of stories, the company would be hard-pressed to even string a sentence together, let alone a story.And so the gathered youkai would dispense with the word-fencing and use their powers to take to the skies to see who could best cover the sky and moon with their powers.And thus it was said that \"a hundred youkai shall parade upon a moonless night.\"Five hundred years on, that little kitsune has already become a mighty youkai in her own right.As for the youkai who drank with them in those days, they disappeared amidst war and history, and their remaining bloodlines grow thinner by the day.And thus did their great parade, the Hyakkiyakou, become something that happened \"a long, long time ago.\""

Thus this action seemed a sacrifice greater than the reward — hardly a wise decision.Some others said that the Guuji suspected something to be wrong with the whole situation, and now that the list of those involved was so extensive, any major shakeup in the Yashiro Commission could destabilize Inazuma itself.This thought, too, seemed reasonable on face, yet did not stand up to scrutiny. After all, was not the rise and fall of great houses merely ordinary in the grand scheme of mortal affairs? And even if the Kamisato were to fall from grace, new leadership for the Yashiro Commission would emerge.Yet another story said that Miko engaged in secret talks with the Kamisato clan head just after the initial shockwaves had died down.But the wounded clan was like a candle in the wind at this point. What power could they have to change the situation?To this day, all these speculations have never amounted to anything, nor have any answers emerged concerning Miko's actions and motivations.But what none know is how Miko's words that day would become as engraved into the Kamisato Clan as their house's crest.\"That the Kamisato Clan has survived this incident is only due to the Shogun's mercy. Do not forget this in the days that follow.\"These words would serve as a seed of destiny, foreshadowing the Yashiro Commission's future position.In some other time, if a storm were to descend upon Inazuma, and even if they were to come into conflict with the other two commissions, the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan would remember the favor they were shown and abide the Shogun's path to Eternity.This was a move that the Guuji played with no regrets whatsoever."

It's not like the fire brigade has ever gotten a year-end bonus or anything.\"As such, after some preparation, the Fire-Soothing Festival of that year would be changed to no longer feature dancing shrine maidens but a grand, rollicking light novel submission contest.The organizing body for this competition and any subsequent publications, the \"Yae Publishing House,\" would also \"borrow\" the Fire-Soothing Festival Committee's budget.As for the profits? Into the shrine's coffers they went.\"Well, we no longer have many fires, and yet our budget keeps increasing. Thus, this restructuring relieves the financial burden placed upon the people.\"\"Also, the study of lore and the writing of literature and poetry is also a way of pleasing our Archon — surely you do not claim to know more of ritual and ceremony than I?\"That was what Yae Miko said most solemnly to Kujou Takayuki when he came by unannounced.The Tenryou Commissioner was ultimately forced to leave the way he came, stormy-faced, along with his attendants.Little did any of them know that the moment they stepped out of the shrine, the somber Lady Miko would pluck a novel manuscript from the nearby offering box and continue annotating it."

No, I didn't call her out on it. It was pretty fun to watch her squirm, actually. Sometimes, she would turn back to sneak a glance once we passed each other... I thought about turning around to face her, but I'm sure it would have scared her straight back into her baku form and sent her running for the hills.But, now... she's a lot more comfortable. Well, comfortable enough to criticize me in the reader correspondence column of That's Life, at least. The baku are quick to adapt, I suppose."
