                "text": "Liyue is home to two rival culinary traditions, conveniently named the \"Li\" and \"Yue\" styles. Foodies in Liyue are staunch supporters of one style or the other, and have long been embroiled in a bitter battle to prove the superiority of their style.\nIn this war waged by culinary snobs, ostentation is everything, flavor gets forgotten, and nothing is a simple matter of taste. Much to the consternation of Liyue's chefs, the Li vs. Yue debate eats up all of the region's rare cooking ingredients in the pursuit of ever-more-pretentious dishes.\nBorn into a restaurateur family, Xiangling inherited her fair share of this consternation. But she also chose to inherit the Wanmin Restaurant and become one of the few to push back against the status quo.\n\"Good food is good food, period!\" Xiangling's mantra is an antidote to snobbery as she sets about creating her imaginative and unconventional dishes.\nFrom a pinch of Mist Flower and a drop of Slime Condensate to a handful of unidentified flying insects and even hilichurls' wooden clubs, Xiangling is known to be somewhat adventurous with her choice of cooking ingredients.\nNaturally, her unique approach leads to the occasional disastrous dish. But Xiangling never gives up, because of what her father has always said to her: \"There are many secrets to cooking; the most important of which is passion.\""

Wanmin Restaurant was no exception.\"Good food is good food, period!\"The monopoly on luxurious ingredients such as matsutake and crabs infuriated Xiangling, her angry response to which was to take over in the kitchen.It was time for her to build upon the foundation her father gave her and make some changes.\"I'm gonna make super-delicious dishes out of any ingredient!\""
