                "text": "Fontaine's famous newspaper The Steambird has a veritable legion of reporters it can call upon, each with their own area of expertise. Some specialize in celebrity gossip, others follow the word on the street, while others still focus on political affairs...\nBut among them all, there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest thanks to her seemingly boundless reserve of energy and perseverance &mdash; the inimitable Charlotte.\nUnswervingly committed to the principle that \"nearer to the action is closer to the truth,\" Charlotte has a habit of popping up literally anywhere and everywhere in Fontaine &mdash; from its widest avenues to its narrowest back alleys, its highest vantage points to its lowest subterranean vaults, even its tallest mountains to its deepest undersea caverns. She captures the \"truth\" with her Kamera, records it in her articles, and finally unveils it for all to see.\nAnd when the \"truth\" comes out, she's met with a variety of different reactions ranging from applause, to embarrassment, to outright fury. There are even some who would resort to any means necessary to make a particular article connected to themselves disappear. Or alternatively, just make Charlotte disappear.\nFor this reason, the newspaper's Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie has on numerous occasions felt the need to distance Charlotte from the Court of Fontaine by sending her off on faraway \"field reporting\" jobs, only recalling her once the Maison Gardiennage or Special Security and Surveillance Patrol had finally managed to clear things up.\nBut despite all this, neither the toil of the job itself nor the pressure of external denunciations and threats has ever  Charlotte in the slightest.\nWith her trusty companion Monsieur Verite by her side, she invariably carries out her journalistic duties with unfaltering fervor, rushing about in pursuit of all the \"truths\" out there just waiting to be discovered."

The beauty of a solitary shell on the seashore, and the tiny crab surveying the world from underneath. The Blubber Profiterole she had with her family on her birthday, and the ever-so-slightly-too-deep color of the cream...<!--\n              -->To most, a flower is a flower, a shell is a shell, and a Profiterole is still a Profiterole even if it is a bit too sweet — that's just how the world is.<!--\n              -->But to Charlotte, these hidden \"details\" — only visible out of the corners of her eyes — are essential to understanding the world.<!--\n              -->Charlotte's father, a seasoned reporter and professional nature photographer, noticed his daughter's interest in and knack for \"observation.\" Thus, on her tenth birthday, he gave her a custom-made Kamera, its dimensions and the positions of its buttons built specially for her.<!--\n              -->\"Not all people are attentive enough to seek out and observe subtle differences, but this, Charlotte, is your unique talent.\"<!--\n              -->Those were the words of her father, the \"Reporter of the Idylls,\" Galanopoulo.<!--\n              -->From then on, there was a little junior reporter by the senior reporter's side.

I don't know why, but somehow, she's found herself at the epicenter of all sorts of bad news lately... Luckily for her, I've been snatching up all the articles that mention her and doing whatever damage control I can before they get published. Heh, and uh... then getting told off constantly by Euphrasie for interfering... But y'know, I think Navia deserves a break, so I'm happy to take one for the team. Also, she agreed to do an in-depth exclusive interview, which definitely sweetens the deal!"

As long as I keep digging, I'll find it — and when I do, it will shake the world like no other news report in history!"

Anyone with a bad attitude is literally sent flying back out the door. Seriously! I snapped a photo of a guy being thrown out once, he was like four feet in the air!"

I gotta say, though, my heart was in my mouth watching him completely dismantle Monsieur Verite in a matter of seconds... Amazing he managed to reassemble it just as swiftly. He seems very experienced — I was convinced he must have graduated from the Fontaine Research Institute, but he denied it."

Apparently, she was so picky that the poor guy once had to take 127 shots of her in the same pose before she was content..."

As well as The Steambird, I also looked at some other independent publications out there, which tend to be more specialized. For example, there's \"The Observer\" for celebrity gossip, \"Leisure Weekly,\" which focuses on competitive sport and other entertainment news, \"Top Chef\" for those who like to read... all the food critiques in one place, and \"Bedazzled!\" which is just sort of a glorified rumor and speculation mill. I learned a whole lot from reading all those papers. Or... Well, I at least learned how to master a bunch of different writing styles."

I disguised myself as a vagrant, infiltrated the back kitchen, took a job as a kitchen hand, and stuck around until I'd gathered enough solid evidence about their misdeeds. Then, I put it all in an article and had it published in the paper. The backlash was intense. They were punished for their crimes, sure, but that didn't stop them from launching a vicious campaign of vengeance against me almost immediately. I was coming home to threat letters sitting on my bedside table on a daily basis, and we'd also find mud slung on the front door to our office... The Steambird quickly filed a report to the Gardes, and I was sent to Mondstadt to report on Genius Invokation TCG. It took a while before I could safely return to Fontaine. These kind of things happen all the time. I honestly don't know Euphrasie deals with it..."

Every time I see something where I think a secret might be hiding, I snap a photo with my Kamera and add it to my collection.

I've also met a lot of people along the way: all my Fontaine friends, Euphrasie, who believes I was born to be a journalist, and people like you, who join me in the search for the truth. Without everyone's help, I'd probably still be that nosy kid who runs around furiously snapping photos like a lunatic... Anywho... It's not often that I get to be the interviewee, but... this has been a real pleasure."
