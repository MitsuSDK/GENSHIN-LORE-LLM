The Three Moons were once satellites that guarded Teyvat, and the Moon Sisters were executors of the planet's will. Celestia's principles were once quite \"tolerant,\" not necessarily requiring the exclusion of those divergent from itself.<!--\n              -->For the Three Moon Goddesses, their sole duty was to maintain the planet's existence and operation. And so the moonlight continued to illuminate the lands of Teyvat. Alas, even they, who kept to themselves, could not remain uninvolved. Inevitably, conflicts between those in power would affect some of those who were subordinate to them.<!--\n              -->If any survivors of bygone golden Hyperborea yet endured to the present day, they would surely have many tales to tell, but alas, the Frostmoon Scions do not understand their ancestors' grievances. They can now only pray to the bright moon in vain.<!--\n              -->In this, Lauma was relatively fortunate, even amongst blind believers. She did not know anything of the above, but she could nonetheless sense keenly that the full moon in the sky was bright yet lifeless. Rather, the tides that truly moved her heart and caused her antler-crown to grow were somewhere farther away, beyond her reach.<!--\n              -->This feeling had troubled her for a long time, and like how one might feel if made to pray to an apple painted on canvas, beseeching it to satisfy their hunger, she was ever restless.<!--\n              -->Fortunately, this question was now answered at last. Although the sky had suddenly \"become\" fake, she had confirmed the authenticity of her senses.<!--\n              -->She had never thought ignorance to be a good thing, even if the truth was more unsettling. Life could never be lived entirely as one wished — indeed, life itself was born of contradictions. But at least it need not be tainted by lies and concealment."

These might seem irrational to others, so for the longest time, she never mentioned them to anyone.<!--\n              -->She believed that she must never lie. Silence, too, was an answer in the face of uncertainty, but one must never fabricate facts to fashion peace papered over. This was especially so for a Moonchanter, one whose every word the believers all too easily took for truth. Thus, lying was an unforgivable sin.<!--\n              -->But was praying to a false moon in the sky a lie in itself? She could not be sure of that, and this again left her feeling restless.<!--\n              -->She resolved that she must never give herself to wrath. The Maiden of the Grove was to be gentle and loving, just as the Frost Moon's goddess was. The lake's light beneath the moon was free of ripples — had the goddess's envoy any right to be angry? The tides of kuuvahki often disturbed her peace of mind, yes, but surely a leader worth their salt must learn to control their emotions.<!--\n              -->Yet some emotions did not arise from the tidal motions. She was not given to shouting or crying out in rage, but was giving her foes a thrashing anger? She rubbed her fingers together somewhat nervously. With whom could she consult on this matter?<!--\n              -->She told herself that she must not change. Over countless years of evolution, the Frostmoon Scions had drifted far from their golden era. Any fluctuation now could snap this precariously perched branch. This was especially so when the faithful viewed her, one born \"special,\" as their hope. She had to maintain an image befitting a Moonchanter.<!--\n              -->Yet she had already revealed the truth about the moon and the sky to everyone. This time, she needed no consultation to know that change had already begun.<!--\n              -->At this point, all three precepts now seemed meaningless. Thus, Lauma finally let her guard down, and one night, she confided these unspeakable matters to her animal friends.<!--\n              -->As she expected, the little animals warmly welcomed her, and as usual, they all chattered away about life — specifically, her life.<!--\n              -->True friends they proved indeed, first affirming her honesty and reliability, then praising her gentle and caring nature, and finally declaring that Lauma had always been this way, and had indeed remained unchanged. (Hearing this made her quite happy, but she then grew increasingly embarrassed... and came to wish she had two extra legs to run away immediately.)<!--\n              -->Finally, a little cat who would often play in Nasha Town concluded: \"If I, Ashru, had to point out any problems... I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Your issue is that you're too stubborn!\""

I left a note under my pillow for... W—Well, not that I have family here anyway, so it might never have been seen, but...\"<!--\n              -->The young man also hurried to add on assurances: \"I'll take good care of her, and I'll bring her back often to visit her friends! I'm not some irresponsible lout — look, I've even proposed to her...\"<!--\n              -->Lauma looked at their clasped hands and the matching rings on their fingers with furrowed brows.

Secondly, I never said you could not leave. Thirdly, one must have a ceremony to go with an engagement. So please, wait here. I will get things ready.\"<!--\n              -->\"...Huh?\"<!--\n              -->Within half an hour, she had gathered everything needed for just such an engagement ritual (including somehow obtaining Nocturnal Blossoms that should only bloom at three in the morning), and in the cramped guest room (with half-packed luggage still scattered all about), conducted a complete engagement ceremony that fully adhered to the Frostmoon Scions' customs (with Lauma playing all the relevant roles — master of ceremonies, bride's family member, and ecclesiast).<!--\n              -->When all was said and done, the young woman heaved a sigh of relief. \"So you were concerned about the ritual, Lady Lauma... I must say, you're quite, ah, stubborn in the most... unexpected ways...\"<!--\n              -->\"Am I being stubborn?\" Lauma tilted her head, somewhat confused. \"This is something that must be done.\"<!--\n              -->\"Ah, yes. And one more thing. Sir, please leave your name, family name, middle name, as well as your fixed address. I will need to send you our sacramental victuals.\""

For one hundred and two years, the Moon Goddess had never once answered her prayers.<!--\n              -->Many thoughts crossed Lauma's mind at once.

You need not answer.\" As Lauma hesitated, the elder gently shook her head. \"Whether the Moon Goddess is unwilling to appear or simply doesn't exist, the passage of time remains unaffected.\"<!--\n              -->\"We Frostmoon Scions can live just fine on our own, can't we?\" The elder held Lauma's hand ever so gently, as though she was the one who needed comfort, \"So unfurrow your brow and smile, Lady Moonchanter. You have done very well.\"<!--\n              -->\"There's no need to grieve over anyone's absence... 'Death may bring forth anger, but anger too is in vain.'\"<!--\n              -->Lauma could not help but smile, even as she held the old woman's hand in turn.<!--\n              -->So she waited, waiting for the painless and peaceful slumber to carry the elder back to the warm sea of life, where at its center, three full moons must surely be reflected."

The history of the golden realm was long indeed, and could even be traced back to the era when three moons rose in the skies.
