                "text": "Mika comes from a loving family. His mother works as an author writing about local conditions, his father is a retired Knight of Favonius, and his older brother Huffman is a current member in the Knights' ranks.<!--\n              -->When Mika began learning to read, his mother went inspiration-gathering abroad with his father accompanying her. During that time, the responsibility of looking after little Mika landed in Huffman's hands.<!--\n              -->However, Huffman had already made the Knights of Favonius his second home — he was preoccupied with work during the day and indulged in drinking with his friends night after night. With his own life lacking organization, how was he expected to take care of his little brother?<!--\n              -->So it was little Mika who learned to take care of both himself and his brother whenever he'd return home drunk at night. When other children his age were enjoying their childhood without a care, Mika had already learned to stick to an organized schedule, sometimes even helping Huffman with his everyday chores.<!--\n              -->While they were away, Mika's parents always made sure to send a letter back to Mondstadt every week to keep their children from worrying. Mika's mother, being an excellent writer, could somehow describe the scenery she's seen in a mesmerizing way akin to fairytales. Mika loved to read his parents' letters before looking for their exact location and marking out their travel route on a map. Picturing his parents' wonderful adventures was Mika's favorite pastime.<!--\n              -->Before long, Mika developed a passion for reading maps, and even committed the terrain of many locations to memory.<!--\n              -->Unfortunately, Huffman had to ruin the mood when he broke the bad news to Mika: \"I'm afraid your efforts have been wasted on the map Mom and Dad left us. It's very outdated, and it wasn't very accurately drawn in the first place.\" But that was to be expected. After all, those who with the ability freely explore the wilderness would likely have all become adventurers with nothing but commissions and Mora on their minds. To them, just about any map would do.<!--\n              -->On the other hand, most of those who knew how to draw decent maps were not skilled in combat, so it would be much too dangerous for them to survey the wilderness themselves. Not to mention their limited income, which wouldn't allow them to afford bodyguards. Perhaps the time would come when the Knights of Favonius finally had sufficient budget to hire experts to deal with matters like these, but with Mondstadt as peaceful as one could hope for, no one knew for sure when something as trivial as cartography could be put on the schedule. So little Mika thought to himself: If he could reach every corner of the world just like his parents, and record every detail of the terrain beneath his feet... That would be the most fun ever.<!--\n              -->From then on, Mika set a clear goal for himself.<!--\n              -->\"I'll become Mondstadt's expert cartographer.\""

As it happens, Ella Musk, whom he had gotten acquainted with while studying at the library, happened to be looking for a guide for a language exchange trip to the secluded wilderness.<!--\n              -->And that became Mika's first real expedition. Though they did safely arrive at their destination, due to an error in Ella Musk's word choice, the pair ended up getting beaten by the hilichurls.<!--\n              -->Mika concluded that this setback was due to his lack of combat prowess. \"I need to learn how to protect myself,\" he thought, \"or I won't be able to guarantee the success of my expeditions to unfamiliar areas.\"<!--\n              -->Thereafter, Mika rode the momentum from his time spent learning in the library and began to learn fighting techniques from his brother. Luckily, Mika had a strong constitution and quickly grasped the basics.<!--\n              -->It happened that the Knights of Favonius had just drafted their plan for an expedition set to depart three years later. They were still looking to recruit a few more members to fill some positions, and \"Front-Line Surveyor\" was among the open spots.<!--\n              -->This role had strict prerequisites: those applying for the position should have some level of expertise in cartography, and due to potentially dangerous conditions, they would be leading the team from the front lines, making combat skills a must.<!--\n              -->This was Mika's chance, but it all felt too much like a dream...<!--\n              -->Mika initially believed that he would be invited into the team as an external consultant, but the position of Front-Line Surveyor would no doubt make him a full-fledged member of the expedition — and one crucial to the entire team. He was daunted by the thought at first, afraid that he wasn't worthy of such an important role that according to him, \"only the strongest would qualify for.\"<!--\n              -->His doubts were soon dispelled by his father and brother's encouragement, and he remembers their words to this day:<!--\n              -->\"You don't have to ask too much of yourself. Doing your best to help will be more than enough.\"<!--\n              -->\"Most of the knights are just ordinary people like us, but once we put our strengths together as a team, even the strongest of adventurers would struggle to prove our equal.\"<!--\n              -->Thus, Mika seized the opportunity and signed up for the position.<!--\n              -->He felt reassured that he would, at least, be dedicating his time to what he loved."

Even though torches lit the area, Mika could see nothing but their eerily dark blue eyes that seemed to glow with an uncanny aura.<!--\n              -->At his teammate's reminder, Mika learned of their identity — the Fatui Harbinger known as \"The Captain\" and his direct, elite subordinates.<!--\n              -->As it turned out, their vanguard had bumped into Fatui scouts and an altercation had ensued, resulting in both sides getting jumpy and continuously requesting reinforcements, eventually alerting their respective commanders.<!--\n              -->The scent of gunpowder was thick in the air, the sense of crisis turned Mika's limbs numb and cold.<!--\n              -->He couldn't help visualizing the confrontation escalating into an armed conflict, and what he should do if such a thing were to happen...<!--\n              -->The Harbinger, in particular — Mika knew that he would be utterly helpless to parry a single half-hearted swipe from this person.<!--\n              -->His jumbled thoughts and exhaustion made it difficult to breathe or focus.<!--\n              -->Varka, however, seemed completely unfazed.

You can use this trick to estimate the height of a mountain and whether it's climbable, or the width of a river and whether you can swim across."
